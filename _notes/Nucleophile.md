## 2. Strength of Nucleophile

### 2.A. Compare Period of Nucleophilic Atom
+ If Period is Same
	+ Negatively Charged NU are Stronger Nucleophile
	+ When Charge is Same

		+ Stronger Base will be a Stronger Nucleophile
		+ If Basic Strength is Same

			+ Nucleophillic Strength in inversely proportional to Steric Hindrance
			+ As Basic Strength is Independent on Steric Hindrance

+ If Period is not Same
	+ The Role of Solvent
	+ >[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Above Concept

	+ Protic Solvent
			+ Large Ion is a better Nucleophile
			+ $I \gt Br- \gt Cl- \gt F-$

			>F- Ek Hrithik Roshan hain aur Iodine ek chaprasi hain toh hota kya hain, ki Hrithik Ke Agal Bagal Ladjiyon ki Line Khadi ho jati hain aur fir voh sahi se shopping nahi kar paata hain (Mutlab Koi Positive Ion Ko Attract nahi kar paata hain)
			> IPL Protic Large ==== #mnemonic 

	+ Aprotic Solvent
			+ Small Ion is a better Nucleophile
			+ $F \gt Cl- \gt Br- \gt I-$

### 2.B. Order of Strength of Nucleophile
>[!visill] Visual Illustration

+ Whenever the Question Specifically does not tells about the Solvent assume it to be water #assumption  and as water is Portic we assume it to be a Protic Solvent
