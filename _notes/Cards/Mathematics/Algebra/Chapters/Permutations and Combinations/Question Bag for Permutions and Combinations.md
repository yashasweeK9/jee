# Question Bag for Permuations and Combinations
## 1. Question Framing
1. If $T_{n}$ is the number of all possible triangles formed by joining vertices of an n-sided regular polygon then $T_{n}$ is the number of ways we may select 3 vertices out of n points to form a traingle.

>$$T_{n} = \binom{n}{3}$$

## 2. Formula Based
1. Use the 1 Difference Formula whenever you see an Equation in the Question and also the 1 Difference formula can be applied in any form given that the difference in the denom of the C operator is 1

## 4. Concepts
1. $n(A) = p$, $n(B) = q$ then total number of functions from $A â†’ B =q^p$



## 5. Approach
1. In the Triangle related Questions, total number of traingles formed by the points on its lines can be computed by subtracting the non-traingles cases (That is selecting all the three points from the same side) to get the total number of traingles.
