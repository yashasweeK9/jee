>Number of ways of selection of $r$ objects out of $n$ distinct objects
>$$^nC_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!*r!}$$

>[!faq] Observations
>$$0!=1$$
>$$n! = (n-1)!*n$$



## 1 Cases
### 1.1 Total Ways
<mark class="hltr-cyan">Total number</mark> of ways of selection out of $n$ distinct objects is <mark class="hltr-blue">$2^n$</mark>
