>We have to Take Product of t1t2 as it will result in x1+x2


## 5. Complex Numbers
Unko Kholo aur Aur Equation mein Put Karne Ki Koshish karo.
Re(z) ko tum complex equation ke real part se replace kar sakte ho aur Imaginaney part ko Imaginary Part se




## 6. Remainder Problem
1. Use Binomial Theorem to Reduce the Equation in the Format N = Remainder + Divider(Quotient), by using Binomial Theorem.
