1. Equality holds when terms involved are equal
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration for Equality between A.M, G.M and H.M
>$$A.M = G.M = H.M$$
>if all the terms of all of the progressions are equal
3. >[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration for Relation between A.M, G.P and H.M
>$$(G.M)^2 = A.M * H.M$$
>They are in G.P
## 6. [[Arithmetic and Geometric Progression]]
## 7. [[Sigma Notation]]
## 8. Method of Difference
>[!conc] Concept of Method of Difference
