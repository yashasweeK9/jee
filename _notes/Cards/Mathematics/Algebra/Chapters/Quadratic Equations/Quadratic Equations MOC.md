# Quadratic Equations
## Polynomials
>![](https://i.imgur.com/9P46g7z.png)
1. Power of $x$ is a Whole Number
2. Highest Power of $x$ is __limited__. i.e. Degree of the Polynomial
3. All real number are polynomials with degree $0$
4. A polynomial of degree $n$ has $n$ roots
	Roots may be Real or Imaginary
### Remainder Theorem
1. Method 1 : Long Division Method

2. Method 2 : $x-\alpha$ Method
> Equate the Divisor to $0$ and find the value of the polynomial at the Result of previous Equation of the Divisor to $0$

> Proof : [[Division]]

3. Method 3 : Factor Theorem

> 1. Coefficient of Highest Power must not be $0$
> 2. $$ax^2+bx+c = a(x-\alpha)*(x-\beta)$$
> 3. Here $x-\alpha$ and $x-\beta$ are factors of $ax^2+bx+c$

4. Importance of Determinants
	1. When $D>0$ Real & Distinct Roots (Graph Cuts X-Axis)

	2. When $D=0$ Real and Equal Roots (Graph Touches X-Axis)

	3. When $D<0$ Imaginary Roots (No Interaction with X-Axis)

## Concepts Application
### Basic Mathematics
1. Jub Bhi Kisi Ke Terms mein Kisi Ka Question Puche toh Equation Manipulation Karke Non Required Terms Hata Doh.
### Complex Number
1. [[Unity#Cube Roots of Unity]]
$1 + w + w^2 = 0$ & $w^3 = 1$

### Solutions of Triangles
For Cos A :
$b^2+c^2-a^2 < 2bc$
$a^2+b^2-c^2 < 2ab$
$a^2+c^2-b^2 < 2ac$
$--------$
$$\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{ab+bc+ac} \lt 2$$

### Rolle's Theorem
Rolle’s theorem, in analysis, special case of the mean-value theorem of differential calculus. Rolle’s theorem states that if a function _f_ is continuous on the closed interval [_a_, _b_] and differentiable on the open interval (_a_, _b_) such that _f_(_a_) = _f_(_b_), then _f_′(_x_) = 0 for some _x_ with _a_ ≤ _x_ ≤ _b_
