2. Use this when Relation between [[Quadratic Equations MOC#Relation Between Roots and Coefficients|Roots and Coefficients]] are not capable enough to solve the Question #byExperience

## 1.1 Discriminant of the Quadratic Equations

If a Quadratic Equation is Given $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ then,
$$Discriminant = \sqrt{b^2-4*a*c}$$

## 1.2 Relation Between Roots and Coefficients

### 1.2.1 Quadratic Equations

2. Sum of Roots = $$\alpha + \beta = \frac{-b}{a}$$
3. Product of Roots = $$\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}$$
4. Difference of Roots = $$|\alpha-\beta| = \frac{\sqrt{Discriminant}}{|a|}$$
5. Equation having sum of roots as "S" and Product of Roots as "P", the Quadratic Equation can be written as $$x^2-Sx+P=0$$

### 1.2.2 Cubic Polynomial Equations

1. $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \frac{-b}{a}$
2. $\alpha \beta + \beta \gamma + \gamma \alpha = \frac{c}{a}$
3. $\alpha \beta \gamma = \frac{-d}{a}$

### 1.2.3 Bi-Quadratic Polynomial

## 1.3 Nature of Roots

Here $a,b,c$ are Real
1. $Discriminant \gt 0$
	Real & Distinct Roots
	if D is not a perfect square and $a,b \in R$  then the roots are Conjugate Irrational
2. $Discriminant = 0$
Real & Equal Roots or __Coincident Roots__
	If $a>0$, complete square of Quadratic Equations can be formed
3. $Discriminant \lt 0$
Non-Real Roots
	Complex Conjugate Roots

>[!tip] For a Quadratic Equation : $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ if $a + b + c = 0$ $\implies root_1 = 1$

>[!tip]  For a Quadratic Equation : $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ if $b = \frac{2ac}{a+c}$ then $a,b,c$ are in Harmonic Progression

>$if b^2 = a*c$ then $a,b,c$ are in Geometric Progression

>[!note]- Method : To find the other root from a quadratic equation when we are sure of the other root.
>Write the other root in terms of the first root, and find that transformed second root into the application of the first root in the Quadratic Equation.

>[!important] For roots to be Rational Numbers they must be the Perfect Squares of an Integer.
