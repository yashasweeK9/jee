# Solutions

## Principle Solution
The Solutions of trigonometric equation which lie in the interval of $[0,2\pi)$ are called principal solution.

### Relation between $\theta$ and $\alpha$
1. $\sin\theta = \sin\alpha$
>$\theta = n\pi + (-1)^n\alpha;$
>Where $n\in$ Integer

2. $\cos\theta = \cos\alpha$
	>$\theta = 2n\pi\pm\alpha$
	>Where $n\in Integer$
3. $tan\theta = \tan\alpha$
>$\theta = n\pi+\alpha$
>Where $n\in Integer$


5. $$\sin^2\theta = \sin^2\alpha$$
	$$\tan^2\theta = \tan^2\alpha$$
	$$\cos^2\theta = \cos^2\alpha$$
	The Relation is $\theta = n\pi\pm\alpha$
