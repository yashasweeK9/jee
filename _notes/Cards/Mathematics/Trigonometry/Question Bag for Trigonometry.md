1. Using Componendo and Dividendo when the expression is $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}\implies \frac{a+b}{a-b}=\frac{c+d}{c-d}$$
2. Find Pattern for $$2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \sin2\theta$$
3. Making Complimentary Pairs and Reducing the Terms by Confirming  to Same Angle then Apply
	>$2\cos^2\theta = 1+cos2\theta$

4. Use Double Angle Formula inversely to convert $\theta$ to $\frac{\theta}{2}$
5. Use $a^2+b^2 = 0 \implies a=0,b=0$ Simultaneously
6. Convert Unknown Triangle to Known Formulas
7. $$\tan(\frac{A-B}{2})=(\frac{a-b}{a+b})\cot\frac{c}{2}$$
8. For Side Lengths a,b,c if $b=a+c$ then the Triangle is a Right Angled Triangle, $90\textdegree$ at B

### Sequences and Series
1. AM GM Inequality
	1. When AM = GM all the terms of the Sequences are Same.
2. When Angles of Triangles are in AP then the Middle Term is always $\frac{\pi}{3}$ #byExperience #constant
### 2D Geometry
1. If ABC is a triangle and a Point P lies inside the Triangle then if Area of Triangle APC,APB,BPC are same then the Point P is a Centeroid
