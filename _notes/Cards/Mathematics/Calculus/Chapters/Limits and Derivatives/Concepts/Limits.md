## 5. Methods of Evaluating Limits
+__ In Every Question of limit, firstly identify the type of Indeterminate Form Present __#important 

### 5.A. $\frac{0}{0}$ Form

#### 5.A.A. Factorization Method
+ Normally Factorize the Quadratic or Cubic Equations and then cancel terms if they do not equate to 0

##### 5.A.A.A. $(x^n-1)$
+ >[!conc] Concept of Expansion of $(x^n-1)$ 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/irImNX3.png)


#### 5.A.B. Rationalization
+ If the Numerator too has the Square Root Part, you have to multiply the numerator and denominator with the conjugate of the Root Part.
+ You may also club Denominator Rationalization and Numerator Rationalization Together

#### 5.A.C. L'HÃ´pital's Rule
+ May also be used in the $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ Indeterminate Form
