# 2D Geometry

## 1. Point

A point is a circle with $Radius = 0$

### 1.A. Distance Formula

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$

### 1.B. Section Formula

#### 1.B.A. Centroid $(G)$

1. Formula

$$x = (\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3})$$
$$y = (\frac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3})$$

#### 1.B.B. Circumcenter $(O)$ #not-important

$$\frac{PG}{GO} = \frac{2}{1}$$


### 2.D. Points on a Triangle
#### 2.D.A. Median
+ A median of a triangle isÂ **a line segment that joins a vertex to the mid-point of the side that is opposite to that vertex**. In the figure, AD is the median that divides BC into two equal halves, that is, DB = DC.

## 4. Locus

A curve or other figure formed by all the points satisfying a particular equation of the relation between coordinates, or by a point, line, or surface moving according to mathematically defined conditions.
