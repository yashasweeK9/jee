## 2. [[Equations of Circle]]

## 3. With Respect to Circle

#### 3.A.B. Power of a Point w.r.t Circle

>Power of a Point P = $P*A = P*B = P*T^2 = S_1$
1. Do not assume that $S_1$ is always more than $0$

### 3.C. Tangent/Normal w.r.t Circle

1. Tangent is a line touching the curve$(S)$ at a point.
2. Direct Common Tangent has Centers on the Same Side
3. Transverse Common Tangent has Centers on the Opposite Side
4. Normal is perpendicular to the Tangent

#### 3.C.A. Equation

##### 3.C.A.A. Tangent

1. Change the following in the Equation of Curve for Equation of Tangent at $(x,y)$
>$$x^2 \implies xx_1$$
>$$y^2 \implies yy_1$$
>$$x \implies \frac{x+x_1}{2}$$
>$$y \implies \frac{y+y_1}{2}$$
>$$xy \implies \frac{xy_1+x_1y}{2}$$

#### 3.C.B. Length of Tangent w.r.t Circle

>[!example]- Lecture Slide for Length of Tangent with respect to Circle
>![](https://i.imgur.com/69buxXN.png)

1. With Circle as Reference, we may draw 2 Tangents to it.
2. The length of two tangents will be equal to $\sqrt{S_1}$
	1. Where $S_1$ is the Equation of the Circle in Standard or Central Form

### 3.D. Director Circle

1. Director Circle is a locus of point of intersection of Two Perpendicular Tangents.
2. Director Circle is concentric with the given circle and its radius is $\sqrt{2}$ times of the given circle.

### 3.E. Chord of Contact

>[!example]- Visualization of Chord of Contact
>![](https://i.imgur.com/FMgzC8A.png)
>Where $AB$ is the Chord of Contact
>Also, $PAOB$ is a Cyclic Quadilateral

1. If S is the Central or Standard Equation of Circle then $xx_1+yy_1 = r^2$ and $xx_1+yy_1+g(x+x_1)+f(y+y_1) + c = 0$ are the Equation of Chord of Contact when $S$ is the Equation of Circle.

#### 3.E.A. Common Chord

+ If $S_1 \equiv 0$ and $S_2 \equiv 0$ be two circles then their common chord is given by $S_1-S_2 \equiv 0$
+ To Formulate Equation of Common Chord Solve, $S_1$ and $S_2$ Simultaneously to Solve the Equation for Chords and it must be given that both the circles must intersect each other at two points

## 4. Circle Vs. Circle

### 4.A. Common Tangents

Let $S_1 \equiv x^2 + y^2 + 2g_1x + 2f_1y + c_1 = 0$
Let $S_2 \equiv x^2 + y^2 + 2g_2x + 2f_2y + c_2 = 0$
Le the Distance between Center of $S_1$ to Center of $S_2$ be $d$
then,

#### 4.A.A. Case 1:

1. No. of Common Tangents $= 4$
2. $d\gt r_1+r_2$
>![](https://i.imgur.com/fjpnck7.png)

#### 4.A.B. Case 2:

1. No. of Common Tangents $= 3$
2. $d = r_1+r_2$
>![](https://i.imgur.com/saKGbZz.png)

#### 4.A.C. Case 3

1. No. of Common Tangents $= 2$
2. $|r_1-r_2|\lt d \lt r_1+r_2$
>![](https://i.imgur.com/7m5xIAy.png)

#### 4.A.D. Case 4:

1. No. of Common Tangents $= 1$
2. $O_1O_2 = |r_1-r_2|$
>![](https://i.imgur.com/IFQEUbZ.png)

#### 4.A.E. Case 5:

1. No. of Common Tangents $= 0$
2. $O_1O_2\lt|r_1-r_2|$

### 4.B. Length of Common Tangents

>Fig
>![](https://i.imgur.com/LLLkZZy.png)

1. Length of Direct Common Tangent
> $$\sqrt{(O_1O_2)^2-(r_1-r_2)^2}$$

2. Length of Transverse Common Tangent
>$$\sqrt{(O_1O_2)^2-(r_1+r_2)^2}$$

 Where $r_1$ & $r_2$ are the radius of the Circle with Center $O_1$ and $O_2$ respectively

>Equation of the required circle is $S_1 + \lambda S_2  = 0$
>Where $\lambda$ is a parameter $(\lambda\neq-1)$

1. To get $\lambda$ we must have a condition
