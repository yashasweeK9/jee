[[Parabola]]
# Properties of Parabola
## 1. Position of a Point w.r.t a Parabola
>$$S\equiv y^2-4ax=0$$

Let $P$ be $(x,y)$
>then $S_1 = y_1^2-4ax_1$

1. If $S_1\gt0$
	1. P lies outside the Parabola
2. If $S_1=0$
	1. P lies on the Parabola
3. If $S_1\lt0$
	1. P lies inside the Parabola

## 2. Chord Joining Two Points

### Equation of the Chord Joining two points
>![](https://i.imgur.com/4YJeHhb.png)

### Slope of the Chord Joining two Points
>$$Slope = \frac{2}{t_1+t_2}$$

### If the Chord Passes through the Focus
Then the __Chord__ is called the __Focus Chord__
>then $t_1*t_2 = -1$

#### Equation for a Focal Chord
>$$2x-(t_1+t_2)y - 2a = 0$$
>Where $t_1*t_2 = -1$

#### Length of a Focal Chord
>$$AB = a(t_1-t_2)^2$$

#### Relationship Between Focal Segments
>$$\frac{1}{AF}+\frac{1}{FB} = \frac{2}{2a}$$
i.e. AF, 2a, FB are in [[Harmonic Progression]]

## 3. Line and Parabola
### 1. Tangent
>Let Parabola be given and line be given i.e. we have two equations in x and y.
Solving, we get either Quadratic in x or in y.
Now, we will find the [[Roots#Discriminant of the Quadratic Equations|Discriminant]]
1. If Discriminant $(D) \gt 0 \implies$ Line Intersects the Parabola
2. If Discriminant $(D) = 0 \implies$ Line Touches the Parabola
3. If Discriminant $(D) \lt 0 \implies$ No Solution i.e. Neither Touches nor intersects

#### Condition of Tangency
>Let $y = mx+c$ be a tangent to parabola $y^2 = 4ax$
>then, $$c=\frac{a}{m}$$

i.e. For a line equation $y=mx+c$, the condition of tangency i.e. $c=\frac{a}{m}$ must be true to call it a tangent to a parabola $y^2=4ax$

#### Equation of a Tangent
Let S be a parabola with $S\equiv y^2-4ax = 0$
##### General Equation of a Tangent
then, equation of tangent at (x,y) is
1. $$T\equiv yy_1-2a(x+x_1)=0$$
2. >[!note] Slope of above equation of tangent 
	>$$m_T = \frac{2a}{y_1}$$

##### Variable Point Equation of a Tangent
then, equation of tangent at $(at^2,2at)$ is
1. $$T\equiv ty = x+at^2$$
2. >[!note] Slope of above equation of tangent 
	>$$m_T = \frac{1}{t}$$

##### Slope Form Equation of a Tangent
then, equation of tangent at Slope $\frac{1}{t} = m$ is
1. $$T\equiv y = mx+\frac{a}{m}$$
2. >[!note] Point of Touching of the above equation of tangent 
	>$$(\frac{a}{m^2},\frac{2a}{m})$$

Area of $(\Delta ABC) = 2(area(\Delta PQR))$
### 2. Normal
##### General Equation of a Normal
then, equation of Normal at (x,y) is
1. $$N\equiv y-y_1=\frac{-y_1}{2a}(x-x_1)$$
2. >[!note] Slope of above equation of tangent 
	>$$m_T = -\frac{y_1}{2a}$$

##### Variable Point Equation of a Tangent
then, equation of Normal at $(at^2,2at)$ is
1. $$N\equiv -tX + 2at+at^3$$
2. >[!note] Slope of above equation of tangent 
	>$$m_T = -t$$

##### Slope Form Equation of a Tangent
then, equation of Normal at Slope $\frac{1}{t} = m$ is
1. $$T\equiv y = mx-2am-am^3$$
##### Results on Normal
1. If normal at $P(at_1^2,2at_1)$ passes through $Q(at_2^2,2at_2)$ then $$t_2 = -t_1-\frac{2}{t_1}$$ #more-important
