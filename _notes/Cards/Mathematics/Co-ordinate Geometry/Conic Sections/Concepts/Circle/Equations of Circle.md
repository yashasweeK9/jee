## B. Equations of Circle
1. When Two Equations of Circles have Same x and y coefficients then they are __Concentric circles__. #concept 
### i. Central Form (Center and Radius Form)
>$$(x-\alpha)^2 + (y-\beta)^2 = r^2$$

### ii. Standard Form
1. Put $(x,y) = (0,0)$ i.e. Let the Center of the Circle be at Origin $(0,0)$
>$$x^2+y^2 = r^2$$

### iv. Two Point and Circumference Angle Form
Equation of a circle passing through two points and makes an angle $\theta$ at the Circumference.
>$$(x-x_1)(x-x_2)+(y-y_1)(y-y_2)\pm \cot \theta$$

#### a. Diametric Form
If two point and Circumference angle form makes $\theta = 90\textdegree$ with Circumference, it is called a Diametric Form
>$$(x-x_1)(x-x_2)+(y-y_1)(y-y_2) = 0$$
### v. General Equation of Circle #important 
>$$S = x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$
>$$Center(-g,-f)$$
>$$Radius\sqrt{(g^2+f^2-c)}$$

>[!attention]- Compare different Equations of Circle with General Equation only when the Coefficient of $x$ & $y$ are 1 each. If not, manipulate the given equation till the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ of given equation becomes $1$

#### For Central Form
The Co-ordinate of a point $P$ on the circle with $radius = r$ and origin at co-ordinate $(\alpha,\beta)$ is 
>$$P(\alpha+r\cos\theta,\beta+r\sin\theta)$$
#### For Standard Form
The Co-ordinate of a point $P$ on the circle with $radius = r$ and origin at co-ordinate $(0,0)$ is 
>$$P(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)$$
