# Pair of Straight Line
1. Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two line equations then Pair of Straight Lines will have $l_1l_2 = 0$
2. Also the pair of straight line is not a linear equation in $x$ & $y$

## Equation of Pair of Lines
1. if $h^2 \gt ab$ then lines are __REAL__ and __DISTINCT__
2. if $h^2 = ab$ then lines are __COINCEDENT__
3. if $h^2 \lt ab$ then lines are imaginary with real point of intersection i,e, $(0,0)$
4. A homogeneous equation of degree n represents n straight lines through the Origin

>if $y = m_1x$ & $y = m_2x$ be the two equations represented by $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 = 0$ then
>$$m_1+m_1 = \frac{-2h}{b}$$
$$m_1*m_2 = \frac{a}{b}$$
