# Point Line & Slope
## Prerequisite
1. Also Refer to [[Harmonic Progression]]
2. Also Refer to [[Properties of AP#4th|conditionality of AP]]
## Line
### Straight Lines
#### 1. [[Angle between Straight Line]]
#### 2. Perpendicular $(\perp)$ Distance between Two Straight Lines
1. Formula
>$$= \lvert \frac{c_1-c_2}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\rvert$$

>[!attention] Coefficients of a & b in the given equations of line __MUST__ be same or __MUST__ be manipulated to reach equivalence
#### 3. [[Equations of Straight Line]]
#### 4. [[Family of Straight Lines]]
#### 5. [[Pair of Straight Lines]]
### Intercept
1. Intercept may be Positive or Negative
2. Length of an Intercept is __always Positive__
### Intersection
If a line formed out of two co-ordinates namely (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) then a line with ax + by + c = 0 may intersect the line formed above with co-ordinates and it may do so in the ratio of $$\frac{AP}{PB} = -(\frac{ax1+by1+c}{ax2+by2+c})$$
### Slope of a Line
 > $$m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
 
 > $$m = \tan\theta$$

1. Slope of a line may be $\infty$  in the very trivial case as $m+1 = m+2$ i.e. line is parallel to y-axis
 
 Where $\theta$ is __NON-NEGATIVE__ & $\neq 90\textdegree$

### Properties of Point and Line
1. If $P$ lies on the line $l = 0$
>$$ax_1+by_1+c=0$$
2. If $P$ __does NOT__ lie on the line $l=0$
>$$ax_1+by_1+c\neq0$$

3. Perpendicular $(\perp)$ from $P(x_1,y_1)$ on $l=0$
>$$\lvert\frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\rvert$$

### Concurrent Lines
1. Yadi teen lines ek hi point se paas karte hain then we call it as Concurrent Lines


### Angle Bisector
1. Angle Bisectors are always Perpendicular $(\perp)$
2. Equation of Angle Bisector is given by
$$\frac{a_1x+b_1y+c_1}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2}} = \pm (\frac{a_2x+b_2y+c_2}{\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2}})$$

3. To get Acute/Obtuse angle bisector pick any one of the given lines and any one of angle bisectors.
	1. Extract Slope from Each Equation of Line Chosen Above
	2. Equate Slope with $tan \theta = |\frac{m_1-m_2}{1+m_1m_2}|$
	3. If $\theta \lt 1$ then the Angle Bisector is Acute and the Other Non-Chosen Angle Bisector is Obtuse (Obviously)

### Distance Between the Lines
>[!faq] Jub Bhi Parallel Lines Rahenge, shuruaat ke teen terms hamesha parallel rahenge


#### Formula for Distance between pair of Parallel straight lines
>$$2\sqrt{\frac{g^2-ac}{a(a+b)}}$$


## Homogenization
1. Kisi bhi Question mein Origin or Point of Intersection dekh lo, Homogenization karna hain #byExperience
