# Question Bag
# Prerequisite

2. Also refer to GIF Function
3. Cubic Equation Derivatives (One at a Time. Two at a time, Three at a time)
4. Also refer to $$cos \alpha cos \beta + sin \alpha sin\beta = 0 \implies cos(\alpha-\beta) = 0$$

## 1. Concepts from Other Chapters of the Same Branch
### 1. Conic Sections
1. Equation of Circle : $(x-\alpha)^2 + (y-\beta)^2 = r^2$ 

## 2. Concepts from Other Chapters of Different Branch
## 3. Concepts from Other Chapters of Different Subject
## 1. Use Geometry
1. I did not use Geometry and could not fetch two equations to solve for r

5. In a triangle if a line is passing through __CIRCUMCENTER__ and bisects the other side $\implies$ that line is Perpendicular Bisector of that Side.

## 3. Miscallenous Concepts
1. A line may intersect three sides of a Triangle two internal and one External Cut #wow

>I did not know about this concept

2. Jub intercept ki baat ho toh uske co-ordinates hamesha axis mein lie karenge toh tum aaraam se Equation mein x and y ko 0 put kar sakte ho toh go co-ordinates of the intercept. Aur Jo value di hain Intercept ki use tum distance between both intercept co-ordinates se Equate Kar skate ho.

3. When y = nx and y = mx \implies n=m then the co-ordinates of the point of intersection of this line is __Origin__

4. IF two points are on the opposite side of line with equation l then the Multipliaction of the Equation Satisfying these lines are __$<0$__
5. If three line equations are concurrent then the area of the triangle is 0 formed by the co-ordinates of their co-efficients
6. When a Variable points cut at different points on different lines use __Parametric Line Equation__ #concept #wow 
	> Eg. if a Variable Point $A(x_1,y_1)$ cuts the line equation l1 at B and line equation l2 at C and line equation l3 at D then 
	> $$\frac{x-x_1}{cos\theta} = \frac{y-y_1}{sin\theta} = r (r_1,r_2,r_3)$$
	> Respective CO-Ordinates of B,C,D are as follows (where $r_1$ is distance AB, $r_2$ is distance AC, $r_3$ is distance AD)

	> $$B = {(x_1+r_1cos\theta,y_1+r_1sin\theta})$$
	> $$C = {(x_1+r_2cos\theta,y_1+r_2sin\theta})$$
	> $$D = {(x_1+r_3cos\theta,y_1+r_3sin\theta})$$

7. Pair of Straight Line ki Ek Line Bhi Uske Equation ko Satisfy Karti hain
## 4. Quadratic Equations
1. Whenever you see three terms taken 1 at a time, taken 2 at a time and taken 3 at a time. Try to find the underlying Cubic Equation

2. Roots of a Quadratic Equation gives Two Equations of Lines which will help us find the point of concurrency. Find these lines then keeping the constant c same you will get a pair of (x,y) co-ordinates derived from the Coefficients of the respective line equations these are the points of concurrency. #concept
