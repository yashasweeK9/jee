+ P is power dissipated through ir
+ If we differentiate P we find that Kisi Bhi Load Resistance ke through Power Maximum tubh hoti hain when $r = R$

## 1. Comparison of Brightness and Heat Dissipation
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Comparison of Brightness in Parallel Combination and Series Combinaiton of Resistors

+ In Series Connection, $Power \propto Resistance$
+ In Parallel Connection, $Power \propto \frac{1}{Resistance}$
+ Power Rating of the Buld means that at 220V of Current the Bulb will consume 50 Watts of Energy
