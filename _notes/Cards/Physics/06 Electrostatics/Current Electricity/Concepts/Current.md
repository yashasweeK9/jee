[[Current Electricity MOC]]

# Current

+ All electrons inside the conductor moves with thermal velocity $\approx 10^5 ms^{-1}$
+ $i_{actual}$ is the flow of negative charges and in opposite direction of the flow of negative charges

+ Area should be perpendicular to the flow of direction of Current



## 1. Current Density

+ No of free electrons per unit area for a  material do not changes parts, thus it remains constant



### 1.A. Temperature Dependency on Conductivity and Resistivity

+ Temperature Increases Tau Decreses Resistivity Increases (Joh Hmein Lagta tha Usse Uska Ulta Effect hain)
+ Note that Semiconducters ke liye Tau Ghata Zaroor hain pur the Dominant Factor is n i.e. no. of free electrons per unit volume, joh overall Conductivity badha deta hain. __(Tau Ghat ta hain)__



### 1.B. Mobility

+ Mobility is also called as Drift Speed per Unit Electric Field
+ Conductivity is Inverse of Resistivity
