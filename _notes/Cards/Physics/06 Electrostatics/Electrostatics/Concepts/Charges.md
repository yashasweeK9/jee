### Charges in a Medium
1. K is a dielectric constant of the Medium
2. Relative Permitivity
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration for Relative Permitivity
>$$\epsilon_{r}= \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_o}$$
>$$\epsilon = K\epsilon_o$$

### Distance of Null Point from a Charge

## Quantization
1. Smallest unit of charge that can exists is $1.6 * 10^{-19}C$
2. Q = ne

## Charging
### Methods
1. Friction
2. Electrostatic Induction
	1.  It is a redistribution of electric charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges.
