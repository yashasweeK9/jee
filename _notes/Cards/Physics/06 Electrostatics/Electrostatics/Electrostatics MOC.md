### Variation of Mass

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration of Variation of Mass with Velocity of Body and Speed of Light
>$$M=\frac{M'}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
>Where M is the mass of a particle at rest, Mâ€™ is the mass of an object when it's moving, V is the velocity of the body, and c is the speed of light. thus by increasing v, M will increase as the denominator value will decrease.
