## 1. Observations
+ Magnetic Field on the Axis of the Wire is 0 as $\sin\theta$ is 0
+ Magnetic Field formed due to a current carrying wire is circular in nature
+ 

## 2. Direction of Magnetic Field
### 2.A. Right Hand Thumb Rule

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$B = \frac{\mu_{0}*i}{4\pi*d}(\sin\theta_1 + \sin\theta_2)$$
>Where $d$ is the $\perp$ distance of the point at which Magnatic field we are to find out from the Wire

>If theta_1 and theta_2 is not opposite then we may subtract if they are on the same side
