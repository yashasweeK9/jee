title: Force Due to Magnetic Field
---

[[Magnetic Effect of Current and Magnetism MOC]]

# Force Due to Magnetic Field

+ Figure kaisa bhi ho lagne wala force sirf start and end point pe depend karta hain
+ Magnetic Field joh current ki disha mein chal rahi hogi uska force net = 0 hoga

##### 1.A.A.A. Important Points
+ When two wires with current flowing in the same direction and of similar magnitude, are put together side by side, they __ATTRACT__ EACH OTHER

+ When two wires with current flowing in the __OPPOSITE__ direction and of similar magnitude, are put together side by side, they __REPEL__ EACH OTHER

## 2. Force on a Current Carrying loop inside the uniform Magnetic Field
+ Force on current carrying loop inside the uniform Magnetic Field is __Zero__







## 3. Force acting on a Moving Charge
+ Moving Charge is defined on Current Element
+ Rest Position se Koi bhi Electric Field se chala nahi sakta.
