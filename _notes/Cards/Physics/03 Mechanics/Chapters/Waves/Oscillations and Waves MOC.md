[[Mechanics MOC]]

# Waves

Waves is a transfer of energy and momentum

## 1. [[Sound]]

## 2. [[Reflection of Wave]]

## 3. [[Interference of Wave]]

## 4. Ideal Momentum

Momentum and Energy is Constant with Time #assumption

## 5. Types of Waves

### 5.A. Based on Medium

1. Mechanical Waves
	1. It requires medium for transfer of energy and momentum
2. Electromagnetic Waves
	1. No medium required

### 5.B. Propagation of Energy

1. Progressive
2. Stationary

### 5.C. Dimension

1. 1D
2. 2D
3. 3D

## 6. Types of Propagation

We Study about Systematic Disturbance of Propagation of Waves.
1. Transverse
	1. Also Called String Waves
	2. Up Down in the Perpendicular Direction of Propagation
	3. Crest and Trough
	4. It Forms Sinosodal Waves
	5. $$y=a\sin\omega t$$
2. Longitudinal
	1. Also Called Sound Waves
	2. Left and Right
	3. Compression and Rarefaction

## 7. General Terminology

1. Wave length =$\lambda$
2. Angular Frequency = $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ or $T=\frac{2\pi}{w}$
3. Amplitude = Maximum Displacement of Particle from Mean Position
4. Frequency = No. of Cycles per Second = $$\frac{1}{T}$$
5. Time Period = Time to Complete One Cycle

## 8. Concepts

1. Disturbances we create is only repsonsible for Particle's Motion and Not Propagation of Waves.
2. Propagation of Waves is a Property of Medium Only

## 9. Property of Waves

### 9.A. Transverse Waves

#### 9.A.A. Velocity of a Transverse Wave

1. $$V_w = \sqrt{\frac{T}{u}}$$
Where u is mass per unit length

2. $$(V_w)_x = \sqrt{gx}$$
Velocity of wave at height x start\

3. $$V_w = f\lambda$$

#### 9.A.B. Time

$$t = 2\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$
1. At time = 0 is the time when you observe the wave, wave is already moving in real life

### 9.B. Sound Waves

>[!faq]- At Same Pressure in Humidity, Density Reduces and Velocity of Sound Increaases
Higher the Molar Mass, Lower the Velocity of Sound in the Meidum

## 10. Mechanism of Propagation

We are Studying Ideal Propagation  #assumption

1. Joh kisi point pe ho raha hain, voh kabhi na kabhi peeche hua hoga
2. All Particles in the MEDIUM will move Identically as the First Particle and the difference is the only with the Time
3. Displacement at $x=x_o,t=t$ = Displacement at $x=0,t=t-\frac{x_o}{v}$

### 10.A. Relation Between Path Difference and Phase Difference

$$\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\Delta x$$ #most-important

### 10.B. General Wave Equation #important

>![](https://i.imgur.com/ctGjdo2.png)
>At all times the Equation of String Wave and Sound WAVE are Same
$$Y = A\sin(\omega t-kx)$$
K is an Angular Wave Number
Here Y denotes rhe Direction of Particle in Y-Axis
Here x denotes the Direction of Particle in x-axis
$$K = \frac{\omega}{V_w} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$ #more-important
$$\lambda = \frac{2\pi V_{w}}{\omega}$$
Lambda is in $meter$

#### 10.B.A. Fro Sound WAVE

$B$ is Bulk Modulus
$w$ is Angular Frequency
$S_o$ is Displacement Amplitude
v is velocity of wave

1. Jahan Pe displacement of Patticle is Zero Vahan pe Hoga Compression and Rarefaction hoga Vahan Pe Pressure Yaah toh Maximum Hoga Ya Minimum Hoag
2. Negative Se Positive Jaoge toh Rareaction Vahan Pressure Minimum (Kyonki Particle High Pressure Se Low Pressure TAK mnOVE karte hain)
3. Positive se Nergative Jaoge toh Compression Vahan Pressure Maximum

##### 10.B.A.A. Direction of Particle of Sound WAVE

Propagation jis direction mein hain us Particle Ke Just Peeche wale Particle ko Dekh Le, Usse Pata Chal Jayega ki Kahan Jayega Next Particle

##### 10.B.A.B. Velocity of Particle

1. $$V_p = \pm A\omega$$

##### 10.B.A.C. Phase Difference

Jo bhi $\sin(\theta)$ yeh theta he hain Phase

## 11. Concept of Phase

>![](https://i.imgur.com/eVE2m2T.png)

If phase difference is $\pi$ then they are Opposite Phases
If Phase difference is $2\pi$ or $2n\pi$ then they are of Same Phase

## 12. Relationship Between Velocity of Particle and Velocity of Wave

$\lambda \gt\gt\gt A$

## 13. Energy and Power Tranfer

>![](https://i.imgur.com/NNgpxOf.png)

1. Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy is Zero at the Highest Amplitude
2. Kinetic Energy = Potential Energy = Maximum at Mean Position.

## 14. Intensity

>![](https://i.imgur.com/igvvGXp.png)

1. In case of Sound Wave,
$$I \propto A^2$$
