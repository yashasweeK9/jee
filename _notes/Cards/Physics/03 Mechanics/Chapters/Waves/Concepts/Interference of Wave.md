# Interference of Waves
## Constructive Interference
1. Overlapping in Some Phase
2. $$Y_{net} = Y_1+Y_2$$
## Destructive Interference
1. Overlapping in Opposite Phase
2. Phase Difference is $\phi = 180\textdegree$

## Stationary Waves
1. Two waves Travelling along rhe same line but in opposite direction.

## Mathematical Analysis
1. Only Defined when __FREQUENCY IS SAME__

### Superposition
0. Frequency is Same
1. Medium is Same
2. Velocity is Same
3. $\omega$ is same
4. K is same

#### Wave Equation
$$A_{net} Sin (\omega t-kx+\phi_{net})$$

1. Calculation of $A_{net}$
	1. $$A_{net} = A_1^2+A_2^2+2A_1A_2\cos\phi$$
2. Calculation of $\phi_{net}$
