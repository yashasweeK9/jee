# Reflection of Wave
1. When a wave hits a fixed end it returns back with opposite phase as displacement at its end is 0
2. When a wave hits a free end it returns back with same phase as displacement at its end is Maximum i.e. 2A

## Sound Wave
1. Open Organ Pipe
	1. It behaves as a free end for displacement of waves.
	2. It behaves as a Fixed End for Pressure Wave

2. Close Organ Pipe
	1. The Sound returns with same phase

3. Refraction
	1. During any type of Reflection and Refraction Frequency never changes #important 
	2. But Velocity of Wave and $K$ of wave changes
