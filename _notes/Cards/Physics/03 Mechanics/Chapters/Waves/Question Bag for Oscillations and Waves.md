title: 1. Standing Wave
---
[[Oscillations and Waves MOC]]
1. To take out velocity, Divide $\omega$ by K
2. When Some Values are not known try to make equations of final and initial conditions, such that all the other constant variables are removed.
3. In the Same Medium, p and v are same. Intensity depends in Amplitude and Frequency
4. Sound Waves Produced in gas are __Longitudinal__

## 1. Standing Wave

+ For Node, Equate $$\cos kx = 0$$

## 2. Beats

1. ![](https://i.imgur.com/L3iXqt0.png)
>Maximum Number of Beats = Maximum Frequency - Minimum Frequency = $(v+1)-(v-1)=2$
2. When the mass of the Tuning Fork is Increased, Its Frequency Increases so the Original Frequency is given by $$n=n_0-\Delta n$$
3. When the mass of the Tuning Fork is Decrease, Its Frequency Decreases so the Original Frequency is given by $$n=n_0+\Delta n$$
4. When the Tension in the Turning fork of a known frequency increases, the lower value of the Predicted Values of Frequency of the Unknown body is the correct answer

## 3. Doppler's Effect

## 4. Wave Reflection

1. Bats Catch the prey by hearing reflected ultrasonic waves.

+ Crest to Trough and Trough to Trough Distance

## 5. Nodes and Antinodes

1. There Exists Inverse Relationship Between Radius or Velocity of the Wave to the Wavelength of the Wave and also the Antinodes

## 6. Frequency

1. Frequency-Loop Relationship
>$$f=\frac{P}{2l}\sqrt{\frac{T}{u}}$$ where P is the number of loops and for a String it is 1

2. Fundamental Frequency = Difference of Two Consecutive Frequencies
3. Next Frequency is (n+1)
4. For Lowest Frequency take n and n+1 calculate the new n

## 7. Sound Reflection

1. There may be case of Double Sound Reflection as Illustrated in the below Example
>[!example]- Example for Above Concept

2. There may be a Case of Single Reflection involving getting the velocity of the Sound particle from different reflection case
>[!ex] An Example for such case

## 8. Waves

1. If the Shape of the Wave is Not Changing then, $y_{max}$ remains same throughout the course of motion.
2. To find Velocity from Given Wave Equations Put $X = x-vt$ and compare the equations
	>[!EXAMPLE]- The above Concept is best Illustrated here

+ When $y = f(kx+\omega t)$ then the wave is moving in negative direction


## 9. Resonance

$$f = n(\frac{v}{4l})$$ where $n \in$ odd Integer Because for Even Integer like (2,4,6..) There will be Anti Resonance. Above Formula is for One End Closed and Other Open meaning Antinode to Node

+ When Diameter is given, know that you have to apply the concept of End Correction that is $e = 0.3d$

+ Whenever there is a change in height of the Resonance Tube, we must first calculate the difference in height to account for lambda
## 10. Velocity

1. Wave Velocity = $\frac{\omega\lambda}{2\pi}$
2. Maximum Partial Velocity = $\frac{A\omega}{\pi}$

## 11. Sonometer

1. Minimum Frequency which it can vibrate is the Consecutive Numerator of all the Frequencies Between the nodes.

## 12. Organ Pipe

Fundamental Frequency of an Organ Pipe $(v_{o} = \frac{v}{2l_o})$
+ Closed Organ Pipe has Odd Harmonics
+ To Find No, of Overtones Divide Audible Frequency by Human by the Fundamental Frequency

## 13. Nodes and Antinodes

+ The number of nodes (x) and the number of antinodes (y) in a standing wave setup in a string fixed at one end is related to as x=y


## 14. Phase Different Calculation
1. When it is asked to compare two wave equation always find the phase difference first in terms of pi



## 15. Inteference
1. Constructive interference occurs when the phase difference between the waves is an even multiple of π (180°).
2. For Destructive Inteference

+ If it is anywhere said that the Moving Velocity of body is very less than the Speed of Sound then we may assume that $Velocity_{moving_body}^2$ to be 0
