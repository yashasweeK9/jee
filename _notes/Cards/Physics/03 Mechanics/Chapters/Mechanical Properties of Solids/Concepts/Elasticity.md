# Elasticity
>[!faq] Elastomer,Â any rubbery material composed of long chainlike molecules, or polymers, that are capable of recovering their original shape after being stretched to great extents

>We can see major strain by applying small stress

## Modulus of Elasticity
Modulus of Elasticity = $\frac{Stress}{Strain}$
### Types of Modulus of Elasticity
#### Young's Modulus $(\gamma)$
> $$\frac{F}{A} = \gamma \frac{\Delta l}{l}$$
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/tIw3rBC.png)
1. Bodies of Same Materials have Similar Young's Modulus

##### Elongation
1. Higher the Length Higher the Elongation $l \propto \Delta l$
2. Higher the Area Lower the Elongation $A \propto \frac{1}{\Delta l}$
3. Elongation due to its own weight
> $$\Delta l = \frac{Mg}{A} * \frac{\frac{l}{2}}{\gamma}$$

##### Restoration Force
> $$F_{restoring} = (\frac{\gamma*A}{l})* \Delta l$$
1. Comparison of Restoring Force of an Elastic Body to a Spring

> Where K is a [[Spring#Spring Constant|Spring Constant]]

##### Energy Stored
1. Energy Stored in an Elastic Body = [[Spring#Energy|Energy Stored in a Spring]]

#### Bulk Modulus $(\beta)$

>$$\beta = -\frac{\Delta P}{\frac{\Delta V}{V}}$$
1. Compressibility
> $1/\beta$
2. Units and Dimensions
$$\beta = \frac{N}{m^2}$$ or Pascal
#### Rigidity Modulus
>$$\eta = \frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\phi}$$

## Combination of Rods
### Series

> $$\frac{1}{K_{eq}} = \frac{1}{K_1}+\frac{1}{K_2}$$
1. Elongation between the rods @Equilibrium
> $$F = K_1*\Delta l_1 = K_2*\Delta l_2$$


### Parallel

1. Assume Elongation in both Rod is same #assumption
