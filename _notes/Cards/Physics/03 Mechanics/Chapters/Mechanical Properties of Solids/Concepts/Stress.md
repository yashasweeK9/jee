# Stress
1. The [[Solid Properties#Restoring Force|Restoring Force]] Per unit area is called Stress.
2. We assume External Force applied on the Body is equal to the [[Solid Properties#Restoring Force|Restoring Force]] of the Body. #assumption

### Breaking Stress
1. Jis Stress pe body break karti hain use kehte hain Breaking Stress
2. Breaking Stress is Constant for Different Variations of a Similar Body
3. Breaking Stress is also called Ultimate Strength
4. Breaking Stress = Force Required to break the Body / Area of Cross Section
