# Mechanical Properties of Solids

## [[Solid Properties]]
## Strain
## [[Stress]]

## Hooke's Law
1. Stress is directly proportional to Strain
> $$Stress = K*Strain$$
> K is a constant called Modulus of Elasticity

### Poisson's Ratio
>$$\sigma = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$$
>$$\sigma = \frac{\frac{\Delta d}{d}}{\frac{\Delta l}{l}}$$
