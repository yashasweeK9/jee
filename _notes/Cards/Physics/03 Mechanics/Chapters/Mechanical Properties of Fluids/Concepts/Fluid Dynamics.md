## Equation of Fluid Dynamics
### Equation of Continuity

1.  Nikalne Wala Fluid Ki Volume Per Sec is $A*V$ i.e. __Rate of Flow__
	- Where A is area of Cross Section and V is Velocity of Fluid
2. Nikalne Wale Fluid Ki Mass Per Second is $\rho * A * V$
	- Where A is area of Cross Section and V is Velocity of Fluid and $\rho$ is the Density of the Fluid
3. $A_1 * V_1 = A_2 * V_2$ #important

	>Do not think that the Velocity of the Water will Increase First and Decrease while traversing through the Pipe.
