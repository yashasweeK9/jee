# Fluid Static
## Constants
1. $$V_{fluid} = m^3$$
2. $$\rho_{water} = 1000 Kg/m^3$$

## Force on Side Wall of Vessel

$$F_{horizontal} = P_{avg} * Projected Area$$
## Pressure
1. Pressure is Force/Area

### Variation in Pressure
#### With Respect to Height

>![](https://i.imgur.com/lxLLAWX.png)
>1. Pressure at Height $(h)$ from the Above the Height of the Water Level in Container is $\rho_{o} + \rho gh$
>2. It is so because Liquid is at rest with Respect to Container.

##### In Presence of Acceleration
>1. If a Vessel is accelerating Upwards with acceleration $a$ then it $\implies g_{eff} = g+a$

>2. If a Vessel is accelerating __Downwards__ with acceleration $a$ then it $\implies g_{eff} = g-a$

#### Along the Surface
1. $F_{net}$ along the surface must be $0$
##### Subject to Horizontal Acceleration

> Tilted Surface Ke Parallel Jo Pressure Hota hain, voh same hota hain.

1. Where is maxiumum Pressure?
> The Farthest Point on the Perpendicular to the Titled Surface is the Point of Maximum Pressure #important

### Pascal's Law
The external static pressure applied on a confined liquid is distributed or transmitted evenly throughout the liquid in all directions”.

### Buoyancy
>![](https://i.imgur.com/vb43Na7.png)
1. Buoyancy or up thrust, is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of a partially or fully immersed object
2. Force of Buoyancy hamesha surface ke perpendicular kaam karega

#### Case 1 : Container Suddenly Accelerates Upward or Downward
>![](https://i.imgur.com/jbjO9nZ.png)
1. Force of Buoyancy will adjust itself according to the Force Generated by the Acceleration
