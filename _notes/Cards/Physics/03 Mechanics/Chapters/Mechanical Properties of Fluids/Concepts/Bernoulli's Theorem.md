# Bernoulli's Theorem
## Theorem
> The total mechanical energy of the moving fluid comprising the gravitational potential energy of elevation, the energy associated with the fluid pressure and the kinetic energy of the fluid motion, remains constant.

>$$P + \frac{1}{2} \rho * V^2 + \rho * g * h = Constant$$
>This is called [[Energy Density]]
## Application
### Magnus Effect
>[!SUMMARY]- When Velocity around the Body Increases, the Pressure Decreases forcing the Air Particles at High Pressure to Replace that at Lower Pressure.

> $$\rho * g (h_2-h_1) = \frac{1}{2} * \rho * V_1^2 (\frac{A_1}{A_2})^2 -1$$

#### Velocity of Fluid at Orifice(Dhaar Ki Raftaar)

1. When $V_A$ is __not__ Neglected

Where $a$ is the area of Cross-Section at Orifice and $A$ is the Cross-Section of the Tank

2. When $V_A$ is Neglected

>Where $h$ is the height from the Level of Tank to the Orifice.

#### Velocity of Fluid at the Ground(Zameen pe dhaar ki Raftaar)
>$$v = \sqrt{u^2+2gh}$$
#### Time of Flight (Dhaar Kitne Deir mein Ground pe Pahuchegi)

#### Range of Fluid (Dhaar kitne door jaake giregi)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/224vigw.png)
>$$Range = \sqrt{4(h)*(H-h)}$$

#### Height of Orifice such that Range is Maximum (Kahan Chede Tank mein Jahan se Dhaar Sabse Door Jaake Gire)
> $R_{max} = h = \frac{h}{2}$


### Siphon Tube Experiment
$$v_A = v_B = v_C = \sqrt{2 * g * h_3}$$
