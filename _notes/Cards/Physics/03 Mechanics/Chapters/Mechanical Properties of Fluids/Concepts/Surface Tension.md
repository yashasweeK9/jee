# Surface Tension
**Surface tension** is the tendency of liquid surfaces at rest to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension is what allows objects with a higher density than water such as razor blades and insects (e.g. water striders) to float on a water surface without becoming even partly submerged.
## Direction of Force due to Surface Tension
>$$\frac{F_{intermolecular}}{l}$$
Force of **Surface Tension** always cut Tangential to Surface.
