title: Simple Harmonic Motion
---
[[Mechanics MOC]]

# Simple Harmonic Motion

1. To and Fro Motion of a Body
2. $\vec F_{restoring} \propto -x$
3. Simple Harmonic Motion is a Special Case of Oscillations

## Equation of Motion

1. $F=-kx$
2. $a=-(\frac{k}{m})x$
	>Where $\frac{k}{m}$ is $\omega^2$ Where $\omega$ is an Angular Frequency
3. > $$x = A\sin(\omega t+\phi)$$ #important
4. All $\sin$/$\cos$ linear functions are SHM function

## Terminology

1. Mean Position
	1. Position of a Body in a SHM where the Net Force on the Body is ZERO
2. Restoring Force
	1. Force responsible for restoring body at Equilibrium Position
3. Amplitude
	> Distance between Mean Position to one of the Extremes is called Amplitude.
4. Extreme Position
	1. Velocity is Zero
	2. Acceleration of the Body at Extreme is Maximum
	3. Where a body is released at Zero Velocity that point may be treated as Extreme Position #more-important
5. Time Period
	1. Time of one Cycle is Time Period (One Cycle is Mean to +ve Extreme to MP to -ve Extreme to Mean)
6. Frequency
	1. No, of cycles per Second
	2. $F = \frac{1}{T}$
7. Angular Frequency
	1. $$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$
8. Instantaneous Displacement
9. Phase
	1. Phase simply means an angular term which represents situation of a particle in SHM at a certain instant

## Flow

1. Find Mean Position by Putting F=0
2. To find $\phi$ find x at t = 0 and put those into the General Equation of SHM and get $\phi$
