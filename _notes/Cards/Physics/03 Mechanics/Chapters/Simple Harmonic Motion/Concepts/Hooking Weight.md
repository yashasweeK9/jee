# Tying Weight on to the Spring

1. When a body of mass $M$ tied to a Spring $S$ is Suddenly Released
	1. It will oscillate about the Equilibrium Position
	2. Its ==Maximum Elongation === $\frac{2Mg}{K}$
	3. Maximum Force applied by the Spring = $KX$  = $2Mg$

2. When a body of mass $M$ tied to a Spring $S$ is decreased Gradually
	1. It will stop at __Equilibrium Position__
	2. where $Mg = Kx_0$
