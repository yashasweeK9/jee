# Force

>[!tip] If a number of forces act on a body and the body is in static or dynamic equilibrium, then Net work done is $0$

## Types of Forces
1. Gravitational Force
2. Electromagnetic Forces (Due to Intermolecular Interaction)
3. Strong Forces
4. Weak Forces




## Dynamic Equilibrium

$V \neq 0$ but $F = 0$

## Static Equilibrium

$V = 0$ and $F = 0$
