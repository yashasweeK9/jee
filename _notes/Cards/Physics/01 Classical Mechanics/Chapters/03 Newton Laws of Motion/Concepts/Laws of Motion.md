[[Newton Laws of Motion MOC]]

# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Laws of Motion
## 1. First Law of Motion
### 1.A. Law of Inertia
1. It is only valid in Inertial Frame of Reference i.e. <mark class="hltr-blue">Non-Accelerated Frame of Reference</mark> 
2. <mark class="hltr-blue">Earth</mark> is our Default Frame of Reference (Earth is at rest with respect to itself)

## 2. Second Law of Motion
### 2.A. Law
Newton's second law is a quantitative description of the changes that a force can produce on the motion of a body.

### 2.B. Forces
Refer to [[Cards/Physics/01 Classical Mechanics/Chapters/03 Newton Laws of Motion/Concepts/Force|Forces]]


## 3. Third Law of Motion
### 3.A. Law
Each Action has an Equal and Opposite Reaction

### 3.B. Properties
1. Both Forces always acts Simultaneously (Together at the same instant)
2. Both Forces acts on Different Bodies (Hence, they can not be Canceled)
3. Both Forces have Same Nature
