[[Newton Laws of Motion MOC]]

# Types of Forces

## Normal Force
1. Normal Force is defined as how strongly a surface is pushing another surface.
2. Normal Force Always Acts Perpendicular to the Surface

3. If a body is in free fall condition, the internal forces on the body is __ZERO__

## Tension Force
1. It is a Pulling Force
2. Whenever Ends of Rope are Pulled apart

	2. Tension Arises
	3. It acts inwards from End
	4. It is bidirectional
3. Whenever Ends of Rope are Pulled Apart we Assume these Conditions by Default
	1. Ideal Rope
		1. Massless - __One String, One Tension__
		2. Inextensible - Length is Constant





## Free Body Diagram
1. Motion of a body is caused by forces acting on the Body and not the force applied by the body.
2. If bodies have same acceleration, they can be treated as a System

## Pully or Atwood System

1. Koi External Force Ka Prabhav, M1 + M2 wale formulae mein nahi padega.
2. Body ke Large Hone Ya Na hone se fark nahi padta, fark isse padta hain ki Motion ke Direction mein Kya Body koi Force laga rahi hain

> Uss Badi se 1000Kg ke body ka Mass Zero Maana Gaya kyonki uske force components se hamara motion dependent nahi hain (Also Surface bhi Smooth hain aur Vajan Ka Saara bhaar Normal aur Ground mein bat gaya hain), aage ki taraf koi force he nahi hain

>[!ex] An Example for Supplement of an Above Concept

> Is wale mein 10kg ka vajan ka dependence hain hamare acceleration mein kyonki iska sin component hamara direction ko acceleration mein aata hain.

1. Simply Point of Joint pe saare forces ko Components mein baato aur nikalo net force kya hain

## Pseudo Force and G Effective

1. Lift Upar Jayegi, Lift ki Acceleration add kardena
2. Lift Neeche Jayegi, Lift ki Acceleration Ghata Dena G mein se
## Length Constraint

>Velocity of A is equal to Velocity of B along the line joining the rope.
