title: Radius of Gyration

[[Rotation MOC]]

# Radius of Gyration

>[!conc] Initial Understanding of Radius of Gyration

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$K = \sqrt{\frac{I}{m}}$$
>Where $K$ is the Radius of Gyration, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body and $m$ is the mass of the body

## 1. Dependence

+ Axis of Rotation
+ Distribution of mass of body
+ For Asymmetrical Separation, radius of gyration will change

## 2. Non-Dependence

+ Mass of the Body
+ Angular Quantities (Angular Displacement, Angular Velocity)
+ For Symmetrical Separation, radius of gyration remains unchanged
