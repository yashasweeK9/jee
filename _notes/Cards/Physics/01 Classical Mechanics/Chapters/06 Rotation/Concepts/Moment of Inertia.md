[[Rotation MOC]]
# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Moment of Inertia
+ It is a tendency to resist a change in state of rest or rotational motion.
+ Moment of Inertia is neither a Vector nor Scaler Quantity, it is a <mark class="hltr-blue">Tensor</mark> Quantity

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration of Moment of Inertia
>$$I = MR^2$$
>Where $M$ is the mass of the object and $R$ is the Perpendicular distance of the mass from the Axis of Rotation.


## 1. Variation of Moment of Inertia
+ Farther the Distribution of mass, higher the MOI.
+ Closer the Distance Distribution of mass, lower the MOI
+ If a wheel is to be made using two different materials then for larger momentum of inertia, larger density material should lie in the periphery.
