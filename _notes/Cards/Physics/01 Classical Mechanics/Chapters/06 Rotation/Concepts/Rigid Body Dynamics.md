title: Rigid Body Dynamics

[[Rotation MOC]]

# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Rigid Body Dynamics
## 1 Rigid Body
+ Seperation between any two points does not change over time.

### 1.1 Pure Translational Motion
+ All points on the body move with the same Velocity
### 1.2 Pure Rotational Motion

+ All Points on the body move with an angular velocity with respect to each other
+ Velocities are always $\perp$ to the line of joining



>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration for Velocity of a Particle in a Pure Rotational Motion
>$$V_A = r\omega$$
>Where unit of $\omega$ is radians per second



## 2 Axial Vectors
+ Direction along the Axis

### 2.1 Angular Displacement
### 2.2 Angular Velocity

+ If a rigid body is rotating with angular velocity $\omega$ then Angular Velocity of any point A with respect to any other point B on body will <mark class="hltr-blue">always be $\omega$</mark>

+ Always Take the Perpendicular Component #important 
+ Kyonki Along the Line of Joining, mein Mundi Ghoomi he nahin toh kaheka Angular Displacement toh Kahe Ki Angular Velocity


#### 2.2.1 Velocity at an Angle

#### 2.2.2 Velocity along the length

### 2.3 Angular Acceleration



## 3 Equations of Rotational Motion

+ All Equations of Motions under Constant Acceleration will be Applicable in case of Pure Rotational Motion.
