>Here, note that, when we pull the rope from upper end of the bob, the rope has higher angular velocity compared to the center and much higher velocity compared to the rope being pulled from the bob from downward position.


### 1.B. Acceleration in case of Rolling

>There is a centripetel force acting to the center of the above rolling body, Horizintally there is No Net Force but Vertically a Centripetel is being applied to the body due to the virtue of its motion


### 1.C. Height at which Force should be applied such that friction is Zero

## 2. Case of Pure Rolling Motion
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Case of Pure Rolling Motion

>Here we note that the Force must act on the the center of the body, because agar force ka point of application hila toh pura formula deh jayega

### 2.C. When ground is moving
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide a body in Pure Rolling Motion when ground is moving
>![](https://i.imgur.com/NwaeK1R.png)
>Here,note that, we must equate Velcoity at Point Q with the Velocity of Moving Ground


### 2.D. Case of Collision

## 3. Instantaneous Axis of Rotation
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for an Application of Instantaneous Axis of Rotation
>![](https://i.imgur.com/RqGCkhL.png)
>Here, note that for a moment of a time, we assume the point of contact or the point which is rest relative to the motion of the ground to be an Axis at which the whole body rotates for an Instance, so that we may carry out Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis on the Velocity of points respect to the Instantaneous Axis of Rotation
