>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$\vec L = rP\sin\theta$$
>$$\vec L = MVr\sin\theta$$

+ Direction will depend on Right Hand Thumb Rule

>$$\omega_{earth} = \frac{2\pi}{24 Hours}$$



## 2. Conservation of Angular Momentum

+ If a System Expereinces 0 Net External Torque the Angular Momentum of the System is Constant.

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration of Conservation of Linear Momentum
>$$I_1\omega_1 = I_2\omega_2$$

>When the dancer pushes her leg apart, the moment of inertia about her axis of rotation increases (Distribution of mass changes)
>So, the angular velocity at which she rotates reduces.




### 2.A. Calculation of Angular Momentum
+ Radially Directed Forces (Forces that are directed towards the center of a Circular Body) do not contribute to Torque

>[!ex] An Example to illustrate the above concept

>Here we note that that the velocity must be taken perpendiculary to the Axis of Rotation.

>Here, note that Friction applied between two rotating body is an Internal  Force and by definition would not contribute to the Torque of the System.
>Thus, we may use, Conservation of Angular Momentum.
>Here, for different direction we may use different direction vectors (Like for opposite direction we may use negative vector J Cap)
