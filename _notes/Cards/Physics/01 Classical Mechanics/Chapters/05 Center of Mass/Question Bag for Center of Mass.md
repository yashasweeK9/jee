## Non-Uniform Mass Density
>[!ques] Question #short-trick 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/x44XPXn.png)
>Put $b = 0$ to convert mass density of rod from Non-Uniform to Constant i.e. uniform. Then we know Center of Mass for Uniform Mass Density Rod is $L/2$, checking all other options by putting $b = 0$, we only find Option C to correspond to correct Uniform Mass Density of Rod and hence the Option C is correct
