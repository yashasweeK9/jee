[[Center of Mass MOC]]
# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Motion of Center of Mass

### 2.1 Observations
1. Internal Forces can not accelerate the Center of Mass of a System

Notes
1. Kisi System mein koi External Force nahi lag raha hain toh uss system ka linear momentum constant rehta hain

## 3 Displacement of a System

### 3.1 Problems
1. When Net External Force Along the Horizontal is Zero and Acceleration is also Zero then we may apply this formula to Calculate the Change in Position of the Body Problems.

## 4 Center of Mass frame
### 4.1 Energy of a System
>[!visill] Visual Illustration

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$K.E = \frac{(M_1+M_2)}{2}\times V_{com}^2+\frac{M_1M_2}{2(M_1+M_2)}\times(V_1-V_2)^2$$



## 5 Conservation of Linear Momentum
+ When these are the conditions
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/WtDR6Hz.png)
+ Momentum Initial = Momentum Final
+ Agar Hamara F External Kisi bhi disha mein Zero Hoga, uss disha ka momentum bhi conserved hoga.


## 6 Problems

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$H=\frac{V_{0}^2}{2g}$$




### 6.3 Jumping
1. Recoil Speed

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$V_{Bigger} = \frac{(M_{moving})(V_{moving/bigger})}{M_{moving}+M_{bigger}}$$



### 6.4 Bullet Gun Case
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Reference of Bullet-Gun Case

+ Muzzle Velocity is the Velocity of Bullet with respect to gun

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration for Calculation of Velocity of Recoil
>$$V_{recoil} = \frac{M_{bullet}\times M_{Bullet/Gun}}{M_{bullet}+M_{gun}}$$


### 6.5 Maximum Elongation and Compression

+ At Maximum Elongation and Compression
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$\vec V_1 = \vec V_2 = \vec V_{COM}$$



#### 6.5.1 Advanced Level Question
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Reference of an Advanced Level Question on Maximum Elongation and Compression.
>![](https://i.imgur.com/3AlLdn6.png)

+ Key Points from the above Question
	+ There will be Elongation in the Second Ball when the Length of the Rope has reached its maximum length. Before that the first ball would continue to move as usual without disturbing the Second Ball.
	+ The Force Experienced by the Second Ball will be equal to the force at which the first ball is moving along the line of joining of the forces.
