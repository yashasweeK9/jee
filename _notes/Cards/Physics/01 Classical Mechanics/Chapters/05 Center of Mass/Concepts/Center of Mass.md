[[Center of Mass MOC]]

# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Center of Mass
## Center of Mass
+ On the body or out of the body
+ Represents the Motion of a Body
+ About Center of Mass, [[Center of Mass#Moment of Mass|moment of the body is balanced]]
+ If a body is free to rotate, it will rotate about __COM__



## Calculation

+ Center of Mass always lie along the line of Symmetry for Uniform Figures #most-important 


## Properties
1. Center of Mass of two points always lies along the line of joining
2. If $M_1 = M_2$ it will lie exactly at Midway
3. It will be inclined towards Heavy Mass

### Moment of Mass
1. Moment of Mass is Balanced i.e.
