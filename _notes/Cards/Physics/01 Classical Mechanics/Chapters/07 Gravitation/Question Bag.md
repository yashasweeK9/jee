# Question Bag for Gravitation

## Using the Conservation of Energy Theorem $\Delta E = (E_f - E_i)$
1. I did not know that the body at rest has no kinetic energy. I also did not have [[Planet-Satellite#^e9f0c2|this formula]] for the Total Energy of the Body at Height H from the Center of the Earth

## Using Kepler's Law
1. I did not know about the [[Planet-Satellite#^82709a|Parking Orbit of a Satellite]]. I could not understand the application of Kepler's Third Law

## Applying Force Concepts of Electrostatics
1. I became biased towards finding an Equilateral 3 Planet Motion and could not solve this Question. I was also unaware of the value of [[Gravitation MOC#^0933b2|G]]

## Differentiating
1. I could not work my way out for Differentiation.
I learned that "agar ek chiz ko do hisso mein divide karna ho, jisse ki unka product Maximum aaye, un dono ki aadh-aadha baat do"
