# Kepler's Law

## Law of Orbit
1. The Earth revolves around the Sun
2. When the Earth is closest to the Sun it is called __Perigee__
3. When the Earth is ___Farthest___ from the Sun it is called __Apogee__
## Law of Aerial Velocity
It states that Aerial Velocity of Planets is Constant.
$\implies$ Conservation of Angular Momentum
$(\frac{dA}{dt})$ = Constant = $\frac{L}{2m}$
$\implies$ Angular Momentum = Constant
>$$M * V_1 * R_{1_\perp} = M * V_{2} * R_{2_\perp}$$

## Kepler's $3rd$ Law
### Time Period and Displacement Proportionality
Time Period = $\frac{2\pi}{\omega_1}$ seconds

$$T^2 = (\frac{4 * \pi^2}{G*M})*R^3$$
>$$T^2 \propto R^3$$
