# Planet & Satellite

## Planet & Satellite
1. $Mass_{Satellite} \lt \lt \lt \lt \lt Mass_{Planet}$
2. Satellite will always revolve around center of the Planet
3. Parking Orbit of the Satellite is the Geostationary Orbit of the EARTH whose time-period is 1 Day. The Satellite is at Rest with respect to Earth on this Orbit #remember-explicitly ^82709a

### Orbital Velocity
Jis Speed se, ek satellite ko, ek planet ke chaaro taraf gol gol chakkar kaatna hota hain

$$V_{orbital} = \sqrt{\frac{G*M_{planet}}{R}}$$

1. Parking Orbit of a Satellite is the Geostationary Orbit of the Earth
## [[Kepler's Law]]

## 1.Motion of Satellite (Orbit)
1. Center of Orbit and Earth's Center must be Same

> $$V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{G*M}{R}}$$

>$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{R^3}{G*M}}$$

>$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$$
>Where r is the radius and v is the velocity

### %age Change in Time Period
>$$\frac{\Delta T}{T}*100 = \frac{3}{2} * \frac{\Delta R}{R} * 100$$

2. Total Energy of the Satellite at the distance $r$ from the __CENTER__ of the EARTH
> $$E = \frac{-GMm}{2r}$$ ^e9f0c2

3. Potential Energy of a Satellite from the Center of the Earth
	> $$U = \frac{-GM_em}{r}$$ 
	> Where r is the distance of a Satellite from the Center of the Earth. ^e81e97
## 2.Geostationary Satellite (Geosynchronous)
$$\omega_{earth} = \frac{2\pi}{24*3600}$$
$$\omega_{satellite} = \sqrt{\frac{G*M}{R^3}}$$
$R = 35,786 Km$

## Two Planet Motion ___(Binary Star System)___
1. They will move about the Center of Momentum ___(COM)___

$$\omega = \frac{G(M_1+M_2)}{r^3}$$

$$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$

## Three Planet Equilateral Motion
Velocity of the Planet Such that they always are in Equilateral Motion
$$V_m = \sqrt{\frac{G*M}{a}}$$

The Force Responsible for giving velocity to each particle is
	> $$F = \frac{M*V^2}{R}$$
	Where R is from the Center of the Setup. (Centroid in case of Equilateral-Triangle)
