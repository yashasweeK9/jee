[[Energy]]

# Potential Energy

1. Energy lost by K.E is converted into Potential Energy
2. Change in Potential Energy is Negative of the Work Done by the [[Cards/Physics/01 Classical Mechanics/Chapters/01 Kinematics/Concepts/Force#^66c1d6|Conservative Force]]
$$\delta U = - F_{Conservative Force} * \delta r$$

3. >[!attention] To derive __Force__ from Potential Energy, differentiate Potential Energy with Respect to *r* #important #advance

## Nature of Equilibrium

1. When Potential Energy is the function of *r* i.e. $U = f(r)$
	1. $$Force = - \frac{\delta U}{\delta r}$$
	i.e. the slope of U-r graph

2. Equilibrium Point
	1. $F = 0$ i.e. Slope of U-r Curve = $0$

> At Minima, Equilibrium is Stable
> At Maxima, Equilibrium is Unstable

## Gravitational Potential Energy

1. For Uniform Gravitational Force
$\Delta U = mgH$ where H is the height, the body moved upward
2. Derivation : ![](https://i.imgur.com/S6Zi7Sf.png)

## Associated with Spring Force

1. $$\Delta U = \frac{1}{2}Kx^2$$
	1. Where x is the Elongation or Compression in the Spring

## Associated with Conservative Force

>If there is no friction the block in the Visual will Ascend and Descend Indefinitely, it is the Virtue of the Frictional Force that the Block will stop after reaching the Certain height on the Curved Plank
