## Mechanical Energy

### Types of Mechanical Energy

#### [[Kinetic Energy]]

#### [[Potential Energy]]

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Work Done by Non Conservative Force + Work Done by Other Forces = Mechanical Energy is Conserved
$$W_{NonConservative Forces} + W_{Other Forces} = \Delta P.E + \Delta K.E$$
>[!important] $\implies (K.E)_{initial} + (P.E)_{initial} = (K.E)_{final} + (P.E)_{final}$
>if $\Delta P.E + \Delta K.E = 0$ that is the Summation of both Non-Conservative Forces and Other Forces is $0$
