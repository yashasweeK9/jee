# Work
## Work of a Force
### Dependence on Frame of Reference
1. Work done by a force on a body = $\vec F * \vec d$
	1. Force is __Independent__ of Frame
	2. Displacement is frame __Dependent__
2. Work done by a force {action-reaction pair} is __Frame Independent__ 
Do displacement ke beech ka antar hamesha frame independent hota hain

## Work and Energy
1. Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem : $$W_{net} = \Delta Kinetic Energy$$

3. Net Work Done on a __Body__ = [[Energy#Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]]
4. Net Work Done on a __System__ = Total Energy of the System

### Work Done by Internal Force
1. >[!FAQ] Work done by Friction is $0$ when we walk as the Kinetic Energy is Provided by Internal Forces i.e. Muscular Force in this case.
2. In case of Rigid Body, $W_{internal force} = 0$
	1. i.e. Work Done by Internal Forces in Rigid Body is ZERO
3. Jub Kiska Work Nikalna Hain Naa Diya ho, tubh Net Work Done ki Baat ki jaa rahi hain #assumption
