# Question Bag for Kinematics

1. Velocity $(V_u)$ of a Ball __thrown__ Upwards from Height and Velocity of a ball thrown Downwards from Height $(V_d)$ will be same.

2. For a body thrown vertically upwards acceleration remains constant $(a=-g)$ and velocity a anytime t is given by $V=u-gt$, During rise velocity decreases linearly and during fall velocity increases linearly and direction is opposite to each other.

3. Stalled Escalator means Standing Escalator
4. In Helicopter drop Questions, firstly Calculate the Velocity at which the body will have when thrown from a Height. i.e. $v = \sqrt{2gh}$
5. In Helicopter Drop Question take height as $-h$

## Instantaneous Velocity

1. In an Instantaneous Velocity, particle does not change its direction, so distance is equal to the displacement

## Motion of a Body

1. When the Question asks about the two different times of the same height, here we use Quadratic Equations as it gives us two roots of the distance = time equation of motion

2. When a observer hears something and sees something at the same time, equate the time taken by both things that is sound and aeroplane to be equal

## Graph Related Questions

2. When the Duration of collision is negligible the velocity-time graph moves upward with slope 1 (when the collison is totally eleastic meaning e=1 then the velocity attained by the body bouncing back is same to the velocity of the ball moving downwards)

## Work Energy Theorem

1. Apply Work Energy Theorem in Penetrating Questions

## Force = mass * acceleration
1. Resistance offered to a bullet is nothing but its acceleration when divided by the mass of the body (F=ma)
2. Force Vectors X and Y mein lagta hain  toh X direction nikaalne ke liye, y ka koi yogdaan nahi hain, sirf x swantantra hain apne motion ke liye

## Velocity
1. Velocity of a with respect to b is Va - Vb. In Relative Questions, take Vector Properly with Sign, come up with an Equation and then put in Values.


## Collision
1. When the balls collide, they cover the same displacement
