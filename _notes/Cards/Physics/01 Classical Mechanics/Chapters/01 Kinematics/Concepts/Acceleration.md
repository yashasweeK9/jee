# Acceleration
$F_{net}=ma$
$$a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$$
## Average Acceleration
>Rate of Change of Velocity with Time
>$$a = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}$$

## When $a = f(var)$ #important 
When a is described as a function of a variable.
1. As a function of time $a = f(t)$
$$a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
2. As a function of displacement $a = f(x)$
$$a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$$
3. As a function of velocity $a = f(v)$
>Any one of the following: 
>$$a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$$
>$$a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$

1. The Relation between time $(t)$ and distance x is $t = ax^2 + bx$ where a and b are constants. The acceleration is $-2av^3$
