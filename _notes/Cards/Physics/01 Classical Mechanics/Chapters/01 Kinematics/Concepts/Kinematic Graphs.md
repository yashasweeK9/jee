# Kinematic Graph
## Velocity vs Time Graph
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/wPPwZxC.png)
1. Slope of velocity-time graph = acceleration
> $$a = \frac{dv}{dt}$$

2. Area under the Curve = Change in Velocity
> $$\int dv =\int a* dt$$
## Difference between Position vs Time & Displacement vs Time Graph 
1. Initial Position of a body is set to be $0$ in Displacement vs Time Graph
2. Initial Position is considered in Position vs Time Graph (However, $Pos_{init}$ may be $0$)

## Slope of a Graph
1. $Slope = tan\theta$

2. Positive Slope 
	1. X badhaunga toh Y badhega
	2. Angle $\theta$ of the slope is $\theta \lt 90$
3. Negative Slope 
	1.  X Badhaunga toh Y Ghatega
	2. Angle $\theta$ of the slope is $\theta \gt 90$

## Validity of the Graph
1. In practice at any instant body can not have two velocities, two displacements and two acceleration at the same time.

2. Speed and Distance can never be Negative

3. Time can not be Constant
