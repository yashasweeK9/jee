# Velocity
> $$Velocity = \frac{Displacement}{time}$$
1. Velocity may be Positive, Negative or Zero
 
## Units and Dimensions
1. Vector Quantity
2. Direction in Direction of Displacement 
>[!tip]- Magnitude of Velocity of a body is also dependent on its Direction.
>Changing the Direction of a body also changes its Velocity

## Average Velocity
$\lt \vec v \gt$ = Total Displacement / Total Time Taken 
1. if Distance = Displacement
$\lt \vec v_{speed} \gt$ = $|\lt \vec v \gt|$ ^4a0cea

## Instantaneous Velocity
$$\vec v = \frac{dx}{dt}$$
1. Magnitude of Instantaneous Velocity = Speed

3. The direction of instantaneous velocity is always tangential to the path followed by the particle.
>[!faq] Speedometer is an application of measurement of Instantaneous Velocity
