# Motion
1. Motion is a __Relative Quantity__ dependent on __Frame of Reference__
2. __Ground__ or __Earth__ is a Default Frame of Reference ^749665
3. With Respect to a Frame of Reference, the __Position [[Vectors]]__ of a body is changing with time

## Equations of Motion

^04b17a

>$$S = \vec u*t + \frac{1}{2} \vec a * t^2$$
> $S$ is displacement
> $\vec u$ is initial velocity
> $\vec a$ is acceleration
> $t$ is time

>$$S = \vec v*t - \frac{1}{2} \vec a * t^2$$
> $S$ is displacement
> $\vec v$ is final velocity
> $\vec a$ is acceleration
> $t$ is time

## Types of Motion
### Accelerating Motion
1. When both [[Velocity]] and [[Acceleration]] Vector are being applied at same direction then this type of motion is called Accelerating Motion
2. Velocity always __increases__ in an Accelerating Motion

### Motion Under Gravity (Free Fall)
1. $H < < < R_e$ i.e. Height is very very less compared to the Radius of the Earth 
$\implies g = constant$
$\implies$ acceleration = constant
$\therefore$ All Equations of motion are applicable
>[!note] The Value of $g$ doesn't change when body is in motion under Free Fall
2. Time of Flight $(T)$
> $$T = \frac{2u}{g}$$

3. Maximum Height = [[Kinematics MOC#^584179|Stopping Distance]]
> $$H = \frac{u^2}{2g}$$

4. Time of Accent and Time of Descent
>![](https://i.imgur.com/I7xtRy8.png)
5. Velocity at any time $t$
> $$V_t = U - gt$$

6. Velocity at any Height $H$
> $$V_H^2 = U^2 - 2gH$$
> $$V_H = \pm \sqrt{U^2-2gH}$$
> Here $\pm$ sign denotes that at any height the body will have two velocities i.e. Ascent and Descent Velocities.

#### Projection from Height
When a body is projected from a height, we may do so in three ways
1. Dropping i.e. $u = 0$ i.e. Initial Velocity is ZERO 
	1. Height at any time $t$ is $h$
	> $$h = - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
	
	2. Velocity at any time $t$ is $V$
	>$$V = -gt$$ 

	3. Time taken $(t)$ to displace a body thrown at a height $(h)$
     > $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$$

	4. Velocity of the body $(v)$ thrown from a height $(h)$
	> $$v = \sqrt{2gh}$$
	
2. Throwing a body downwards with initial velocity not equal to ZERO
	1. Height $(h)$ at any time $t$ for a body thrown at a initial velocity $u$
	>$$-h = ut - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
	
3. Throwing a body upwards i.e. initial velocity is not equal to ZERO
	1. Time period of the body #important
	> $$t = \frac{u}{g}+\sqrt{\frac{u^2}{g^2}+\frac{2h}{g}}$$
	
4. Relation ship between the time taken for the body to reach the ground when it is dropped $(t_2)$, thrown directly downward $(t_1)$ and thrown upwards is
> $$t = \sqrt{t_1*t_2}$$

5. Considering Air Resistance
>$$t_{ascent} = \sqrt{\frac{2H}{g+a}}$$
>$$t_{descent} = \sqrt{\frac{2H}{g-a}}$$
>$$t_{descent} \gt t_{ascent}$$

### Relative Motion in 1D
1. Observer is always at[[Rest]] with respect to itself. #assumption 
2. Velocity of A with respect to B is equal to Velocity of A with respect to [[Motion#^749665|Default Frame]] - Velocity of B with respect to Default Frame.

3. Time of Catching/Meeting/Overtaking/Crossing/Collision
	1. When $a = 0$
>[!tip] When $a = constant$, all [[Motion#Equations of Motion|Equations of Motion]] are Applicable keeping in mind the relative frame of single observer.


4. Same Concepts [[Motion#Relative Motion in 1D|discussed above]] apply for Acceleration also.

5. When body is placed vertically to collide, the gravitational acceleration constant acts on the body. (Remember: The Bolt and Lift Example)
6. Relative Velocities are Subtracted in the Same Direction
7. Relative Velocities are Added in the Same Direction
