## Time of Flight
>$$\frac{2V_y}{g}$$
>Where $V_y$ is Velocity in $Y$ Direction and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity downwards
## Maximum Height
1. At maximum height $V_y=0$ and $V_x=U_x=U\cos\theta$ so that at maximum height $V = U\cos\theta$ 
2. At maximum height angle between velocity and acceleration is $90\textdegree$

>$$\frac{V_y}{2g}$$
>Where $V_y$ is Velocity in $Y$ Direction and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity downwards
## Range of Displacement
Horizontal Displacement during motion.
>$$V_xT$$
>Where V_x is the Velocity in $X$ Direction and $T$ is the Time of Flight

>General Formula for Range of a Body
>$$\frac{2V_xV_y}{g}$$
>$$\frac{V^2\sin 2\theta}{g}$$
>Where $V_x$ is the Velocity in $X$ Direction and $V_y$ is the Velocity in $Y$ Direction

## Equation of Trajectory
>$$y = x\tan\theta - \frac{1}{2}g\frac{x^2}{u^2cos^2\theta}$$
>$$y = x\tan\theta(1-\frac{x}{R})$$
>Where $R$ is the range of the body in Projectile Motion

## Projection from Height
### Upward Projection from Height
### Projection from a height at an angle $\theta$ below horizontal

## Projectile Motion on Inclined Plane
## Observations
1. >Time of Flight $\propto$ Maximum Height $\propto$ $V_y$
2. > When $R=H$ The angle between the vertical and plane of projections is $\theta \approx 76\textdegree$
### Comparison of two projectile of Equal Range

>$$R = \frac{u^2\sin 2\theta}{g}$$


1. $\theta$ is maximum at $45\textdegree$
