[[Motion in a Plane MOC]]

# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Relative Motion

1. Hum Hamesha Khud ke respect mein Rest pe hote hain.
2. $$V_{A/A}=0$$
3. $$a_{A/B}=0$$

## 1 Time of Meeting

>T = distance between them/Relative Velocity along the line of Joining
>Opposite Direction mein hain toh Jod Denge
>Same Direction mein hain toh Ghata Denge

## 2 Time of Overtaking

>T = distance between them/Relative Velocity along the line of Joining (Velocities will be Subtracted)
>Opposite Direction mein hain toh Jod Denge
>Same Direction mein hain toh Ghata Denge

# 2.0.0.0.0.1 Relative Velocity in a Plane

## 3 Condition of Collision
### 3.1 In A Plane
1. Direction of Velocity B with respect to A is the Direction of Vector A with respect to Vector B i.e. $\vec{BA}$
2. When a Velocity of a body with respect to other is Constant then the motion of other body with respect to the body at rest is a motion in Straight Line


## 4 Minimum Distance of Approach
>[!summa] Summary of Minimum Distance of Approach
>Hum log ek body ko rest pe maante hain, fir doosre body ke motion ko samjhke, yeh anumaan lagate hain ki body ki velocity kya hain, kitne door ya pass se guzregi rest wali body ke respect mein aur fir vahan se perpendicular distance nikaal lete hain us point ka

1. Bhaukaali Formula
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$tan \alpha = \frac{V_R\sin\theta-V_M}{V_R\cos\theta}$$


## 6 River Boat Problems

1. Upstream and Downstream

>[!conc] Concept of Time of Crossing the River
>Velocity of River has nothing to do with the Time it takes to cross the river.
> Time of Crossing the River
> >[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$t=\frac{d}{V_\perp}$$
>Where $V_{\perp}$ is the Velocity of the man perpendicular to the flow of river
