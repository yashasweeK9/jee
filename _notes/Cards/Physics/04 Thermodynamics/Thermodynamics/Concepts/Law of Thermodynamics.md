## 1.  $1^{st}$ Law of Thermodynamics
$$\Delta Q = \Delta U + W$$
### A. Sign Convention #important

#### A. $\Delta Q$
1. It is __POSITIVE__ when heat is __Supplied__ to the body
2. It is __NEGATIVE__ when heat is __Extracted__ from the body

#### B. $\Delta U$ 
1. It is __POSITIVE__ when Temperature of the body __Increases__
2. It is __NEGATIVE__ when Temperature of the body __Decreases__
#### C. $W$
1. It is __POSITIVE__ when work is done __BY__ the gas
2. It is __NEGATIVE__ when work is done __ON__ the gas
### B. Work $(W)$
1. > Work Done by the gas on the system is :
	> $$W_{byGas} = P.\Delta V$$
2. > Differential Equation of the Work Done by the has on the system is:
	>$$dW = P.dV$$

#### i. Calculation of Work Done $(W)$
##### A. Equation Method
When $PV^a = Constant$ is a Polytropic Process, then Work Done is 
>$$W = \frac{nR\Delta T}{1-a}$$

##### B. Graphically
1. Work done by the gas is the Area Under the Curve of the P-V Graph
2. Cases of Work Done in P-V Graph
	1. When Volume is Constant

	4. When the Process is Cyclic
		1. If Cycle is Anti-Clockwise WORK is negative
		2. If Cycle is Clockwise WORK is positive

1. Molar Specific Heat when Volume is Constant
>$$C_v = \frac{f}{2}R$$
2. Molar Specific Heat when Pressure is Constant
>$$C_p = \frac{f}{2}R+R$$

3. Ratio of Molar Specific Heat when Pressure is Constant to Molar Specific Heat when Volume is Constant $(\gamma)$
>$$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v}$$
>$$\gamma_{mono} \gt \gamma_{dia}$$
4. $C_v - \gamma$ Relation
>$$C_v = \frac{R}{\gamma-1}$$
5. $C_p - \gamma$ Relation
>$$C_p = \frac{\gamma R}{\gamma-1}$$
