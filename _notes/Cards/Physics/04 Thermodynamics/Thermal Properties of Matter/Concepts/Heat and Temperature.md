# Heat and Temperature

## Heat
1. Heat is a transfer of Energy
2. >$1 cal = 4.2J$
	>Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
### 1. Heat Supplied to a Body
1. >$Q = mS\Delta T$
	> Where $S$ is Specific Heat Capacity of a Material 

### 2. [[Molar Specific Heat]]
## Temperature

### Units of Temperature
1. Kelvin $(K)$, Centigrade $(C\textdegree)$, Fahreheit $(F)$ or any scale.

### Change in Temperature
$$\frac{\Delta K}{100} = \frac{\Delta C}{100} = \frac{\Delta F}{180}$$

### Variance or Potential Energy of a System with Temperature

## Water Equivalent
It is the amount of water that shows same temperature change by supplying same amount of Heat as of body.

> $$M_w * S_w = M_b * S_b$$

## Ways of Heating
### Electrical
1. Also Refer to [[Power Rating]]
### Mechanical
1. Heat Dissipated = $\frac{1}{2}m*v^2$
### Hot Body
#### Mixing with Hot Body
1. Concept of Calorimeter : Heat Gain = Heat Loss
2. No Exchange of Heat between the Surrounding and the Calorimeter.

>$$T_f = \frac{M_1S_1T_1 + M_2S_2T_2}{M_1S_1+M_2S_2}$$ 

## Phase of Matter
### Latent Heat
#### Fusion $(L_f)$
#### Evaporation $(L_v)$
