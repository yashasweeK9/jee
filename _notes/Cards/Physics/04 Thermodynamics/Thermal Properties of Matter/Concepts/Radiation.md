# Radiation
1. Throw
2. Transfer of Sunlight

## Pervorst Theory
1. Any body with $T\gt 0K$ must __Release__ Radiation.
2. Energy of Photon = $h\mu$ = $\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
3. Visible Rays Spectrum ranges from $400nm$ to $700nm$

## Emission Spectrum
1. It is the Property of Body Temperature and Emissivity
2. Kitni Energy Nikli kisi Temperature ke Grey Body se divided by Kitni Energy nikli Usi Conditions pe Black Body se.
>$$e = \frac{GreyBody_{radiation}}{BlackBody_{radiation}}$$

## Kirchoff's Law

## Stefan's Law
1. Heat radiated by the body
> $$=\sigma e A T^4$$
>Where e is the Emissivity Constant and A is the Area of the __Exposed__ Surface.
2. Heat Radiated by the Black Body $= \sigma A T^4$
2. \sigma is Stefan's Constant.
3. Value of $\sigma = 5.67*10^-8$
4. When Surrounding is of same temperature as of the body, the rate of heat energy emitted to rate of heat energy absorbed are same.
## Absorption and Emission of Heat

1. Absorption is independent of Surrounding Area
>$$(\frac{dQ}{dT})_{Ab} = \sigma a A T_{surrounding}^4$$

2. Emission
>$$(\frac{dQ}{dT})_{Em} = \sigma a A T_{body}^4$$

## Netwon's Law of Cooling #more-important 
 1. Temperature of Surrounding will remain constant through out the cooling.  #assumption 
2. Body will cool down.
3. $$(\frac{dQ}{dT})_{net} = (\frac{dQ}{dT})_{em} - (\frac{dQ}{dT})_{ab} $$ 

4. $$(\frac{dQ}{dT})_{net} = ms\frac{dT}{dt}$$
5. Rate of Temperature Loss $$(\frac{dT}{dt})_{net} = (\frac{dQ}{dt})*\frac{1}{ms}$$

6. Newton's Law of Cooling 
> $$(\frac{dQ}{dT}) = c(T_b-T_s)$$

## Wein's Displacement Law
 $$\lambda_{m}T = b$$
 Where b is a constant and $\lambda_{m}$ is a Maximum Spectral Emission Power
