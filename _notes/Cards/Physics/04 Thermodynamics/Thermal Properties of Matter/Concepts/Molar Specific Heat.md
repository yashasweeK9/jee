## Molar Specific Heat of Water$(H_2O)$
### 1. Inter-conversion of Specific Heat
$$S_{water} = \frac{1cal}{gm\textdegree C} = \frac{1000cal}{Kg\textdegree C} = \frac{1000cal}{KgK} = \frac{42Joule}{gm\textdegree C} = \frac{4200 Joule}{KgK}$$

### 2. Thermal Capacity
1. It is the property of body and material.
2. It is just the heat required to increase the temperature pf body by $1\textdegree C$

> $$c = ms = \frac{Q}{\Delta T}$$
