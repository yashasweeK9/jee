[[Kinetic Theory of Gases MOC]]
# 0.0.0.0.0.1 Compiled Concepts for Kinetic Theory of Gases
## 1 B. Concepts From Different Chapters of the Same Branch
### 1.1 Thermodynamics
1. Firstly find Relation between different State Variables then use Formula for [[Heat and Temperature#1 Heat Supplied to a Body|Heat Supplied to a Body]] to get heat that should be added to the System.

#### 1.1.2 Kinetic Energy of the Gas
+ When work done is Zero, loss in Kinetic Energy is equal to the heat gained by the gas
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = nC_v\Delta T$$




#### State and Path Variables
+ When a body is suddenly brought to rest. The <mark class="hltr-blue">change in Volume is Constant</mark> and hence $\Delta V = 0$
>[!ques] Question as an Application of above concept in action
