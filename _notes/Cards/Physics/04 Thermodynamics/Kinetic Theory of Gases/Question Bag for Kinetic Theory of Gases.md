[[Kinetic Theory of Gases MOC]]

# Question Bag
1. Average Kinetic Energy does not depend on Molecular Weight of the Body and hence is it Independent of Molecular Weight.
2. To directly find $\gamma_{mixture}$ #commit-to-memory where $\gamma_{mixture} = \frac{C_p}{C_v}$
	>$$\frac{n_1+n_2}{\gamma_{mixture}-1} = \frac{n_1}{\gamma_1-1} + \frac{n_2}{\gamma_2-1}$$ #important
3. When there are two Thermally Insulated Vessels then we say that the Internal Energy of the System will be Constant
	>$$U_1+U_2 = U'_1 + U'_2$$

4. Rigid means no Vibrational degree of freedom
5. $R \approx \frac{25}{3}$
6. Constant Volume has $\Delta W = 0$
7. Degree of Freedom = $f = \frac{2}{\gamma -1}$
8. When the Question says that _"For a given gas"_ assume that the Volume of the Gas is Constant #assumption
9. Time Period Between two Successive Collisions
	>$$t = \frac{\lambda}{V_{mean}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi nd^2}}{\sqrt{\frac{8RT}{\pi M}}}$$
	>Where $d$ is the diameter of molecule and $n$ = No. of Molecules\Volume = $\frac{N}{V}$

10. Also $PV = NK_{B}T$
 11. When Center of mass of gas molecules also moves with the moving frame with uniform speed. There is no relative motion of gas molecules. So, Kinetic Energy and Temperature remains same

## Molar Heat Capacity
1. For Polytropic Process
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$C = C_v + \frac{R}{1-n}$$
>Where C is the Constant Molar Heat Capacity
