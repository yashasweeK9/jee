# Graphs

## Increasing Function

1. When Change in One Quantity brings the same change in the other Quantity.

## Decreasing Function

1. When change in One Quantity brings __Opposite__ or __Inverse__ Change in other Quantity.

## Methods

1. If two graph seems same then formulate the Value of one Quantity when it tends to $\infty$ and then map the other Quantity's Value respect to previous $\infty$ value. This methods helps you define the Borders of the Graphs.
