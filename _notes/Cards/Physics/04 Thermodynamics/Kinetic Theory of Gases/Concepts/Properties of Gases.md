# Properties of Gases

## Speed

### Average Velocity

>$$<\vec v> = 0$$

>$$v_{avg} = \sqrt{\frac{8kT}{\pi m}}$$

### Root Mean Square Velocity

>$$v_{rms} = 1.73 \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}}$$
>Where _$k$_ is __Boltzman's constant__, T is temperature

### Most Probable Velocity

>$$v_{mp} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}$$

## Degree of Freedom $(f)$

### 1. Translational Degree of Freedom

There are maximum three degree of freedom corresponding to transalational motion.

### 2. Rotational Degree of Freedom

The number of degrees of freedom in this case depends on the structure of the molecule.

### 3. Vibrational Degree of Freedom

It is exhibited at High Temperature.

### 4. Degree of Freedom in Variance with Structure of Molecule

## Laws

### Maxwell's Law of Equipartition of Energy

1. Energy associated with Molecules
2. Each degree of freedom is constant = $\frac{1}{2}KT$
3. $U_{Nmole} = N*\frac{f}{2}RT$
4. Energy of the Gas, E = $\frac{fnRT}{2}$
5. Kinetic Energy of a Gas Molecule = $$\frac{f*n*r*t}{2}$$
