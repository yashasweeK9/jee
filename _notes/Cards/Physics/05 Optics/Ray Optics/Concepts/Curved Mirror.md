# Curved Mirror

## 1. Spherical Mirror `far:Circle`

- All perpendicular from the curve passes through its center.
- Mirror is a very small part of sphere.

- All rays incident on it will have small angle of incidence.
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$i \to 0$$

#### 1.A.A. Focus

>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Focus

+ Meeting point of rays coming parallel to Principle Axis
+ Focus
	+ For Paraxial Rays $f=\frac{R}{2}$
	+ For Marginal Rays $f=\frac{R}{2\cos\theta}$
+ In Marginal Rays, focus does not form over a point but it is formed in a range and hence we call that term as <mark class="hltr-blue">Spherical Abberation</mark>
