# ‚ùáÔ∏è Mirror

## 1. Plain Mirror

+ Object is the meeting point of incident ray
+ Image is the meeting point of Reflecting or refracting ray.
+ $X_{I/M} = -X_{O/M}$ #important

## 2. Nature of Image and Object

+ If Reflecting or refracting rays are diverging in nature then the Image is <mark class="hltr-blue">__Virtual__</mark> in nature.
+ If Reflecting or refracting rays are converging in nature then the image is __<mark class="hltr-blue">Real</mark> __ in nature
+ Size of the Image remains same as magnification is unit in nature.

### 2.B. Field of View

#### 2.B.A. Principle of Reversibility ‚Ü©Ô∏è

+ Ray will trace its path if reflected back by 180$\textdegree$
+ The Area between the reflection from one end of a mirror to the other end is called <mark class="hltr-blue">__Field of View__</mark>

+ Height of mirror should be half of height of the person looking into the mirror.
+ The height of mirror is <mark class="hltr-blue">independent</mark> of the distance between the object and the mirror

#### 2.B.B. Extended Object or Mirror

+ Agar object, mirror ke line se upar hain toh voh mirror mein dikhega.

#### 2.B.C. Image on Inclined Mirror

+ Image will always be along Reflecting Line

#### 2.B.D. Image Fomed Between Two Plain Mirror

#### 2.B.E. Effect of Rotation of Object and Mirror üîÑ

+ If Reflecting ray will rotate by angle $2\theta$, if mirror roates by $\theta$

#### 2.B.F. Images Formed Through Mirror Inclined to Each Other.
