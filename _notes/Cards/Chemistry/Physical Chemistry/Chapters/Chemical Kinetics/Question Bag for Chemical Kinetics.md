## 4. Experimental Value Order Questions



## 5. Half Life
### 5.A. First Order Reaction
+ ![](https://i.imgur.com/HxAPbbV.png)
+ Thus, half-life period $(t_\frac{1}{2})$ of a first order reaction does not depend upon the concentration.



## 6. Rate of Reaction
+ Average Rate of Reaction

## 8. Order of Reactions
+ You may also fetch the order of the reaction from the units used in the Question, as this is very important and essential step
