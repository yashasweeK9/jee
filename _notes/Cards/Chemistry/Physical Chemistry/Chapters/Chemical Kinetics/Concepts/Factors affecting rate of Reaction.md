>2. Order may be Positive or Negative or an Integer or a Fraction



#### 1.B.A. Zero Order Reaction
**A chemical reaction in which the rate of reaction is constant and independent of the concentration of the reacting substances**

>1. In Zero Order Reaction, the Concentration decreases lineraly with time.


4. Most of the Heterogeneous catalytic reaction are zeroth order reactions.
5. Most of the <mark class="hltr-blue">Photo-chemical</mark> reactions follow Zeroth Order __Kinetics__

#### 1.B.B. First Order Reaction
+ **A chemical reaction in which the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reacting substance**
1. >[!conc] Initial Concept of First Order Reaction

>Where $[A_{0}] =$ Initial Concentration
>Where $[A_{t}] =$ Concentration after Time T 

2. >[!visill] Visual Illustration of Time Vs. Rate Graph of First Order Reaction

>1. In first order reaction, the rate decreases linearly with Concentration

##### 1.B.B.B. Half-Life Time or Half Life Time Period for First Order Reaction
1. Half Life Time Period for First Order Reaction
>[!visill] Visual Illustration
>![](https://i.imgur.com/qijWlw1.png)

>1. Half Life time is independent of initial Concentration



#### 1.B.C. Nth Order Reaction
##### 1.B.C.A. Half Life Time Period
>[!visill] Visual Illustration
>![](https://i.imgur.com/qGpHmjo.png)

#### 1.B.D. Observations
1. The Concentration decreases exponentially with time.
2. The First Order Reaction is never $100\%$ Completed





### 1.C. Molecularity

### 1.D. Observation
1. For Elementary step reaction, order and Molecularity are numerically same
2. Order of one-step reaction can not be fractional

## 3. Half Life Time
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Half Life Period or Half Life Time
>![](https://i.imgur.com/bgeWGAF.png)


1. The time required for the Concentration of reactants to become half of the initial value, thus it is known as the half life time of the reaction.
2. A reaction can have infinite number of half life and the magnitude of the half lives may not be same either.






## 4. Rate of Reaction affected by Temperature, Nature and Catalyst
Also Refer to [[Collision Theory of Kinetics]]
### 4.A. Arrhenius Equation
>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$k=Ae^{{\frac  {-E_{a}}{RT}}}$$
>![](https://i.imgur.com/JwRJpjs.png)


>[!conc] Concept
>The Arrhenius equation is an expression that provides a relationship between the rate constant (of a chemical reaction), the absolute temperature, and the A factor (also known as the pre-exponential factor or frequency factor) can be visualized as the frequency of correctly oriented collisions between reactant particles). It provides insight into the dependence of reaction rates on the absolute temperature.

It Describes the effect of Temperature, Nature of Reaction, Catalyst on the rate constant of the Reaction

##### 4.A.A.A. Proper-Improper Collision
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Above Concept

2. The molecule must collide with <mark class="hltr-blue">Proper Orientation</mark> 


#### 4.A.B. Arrhenius Relation to Collision Frequency
1. >[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration
>$$A = (Z\sigma)$$
>Where $Z$ is Collision Frequency
>Where $\sigma$ is Steric Factor

#### 4.A.D. Standard Equations
>[!visill] Visual Illustration

>![](https://i.imgur.com/hDmnoba.png)

#### 4.A.E. Observations
1. Rate Constant is actually the <mark class="hltr-blue">Probability</mark> of a Successful Collision




### 4.B. Catalyst
A Catalyst can change the rate of constant of a reaction at constant Temperature.




#### 4.B.A. Positive Catalyst
1. Positive Catalyst increases the rate constant and hence it is called positive Catalyst
2. Default Catalyst in our Question (if nothing is mentioned) #byExperience  #assumption 
3. >[!visill] Visual Illustration of a Positive Catalyzed Reaction
>![](https://i.imgur.com/2aKPpoi.png)


4. A Positive Catalyst provides an alternative pathway to the same final product an it requires comparatively less activation energy
5. In Presence of a Positive Catalyst, the rate constant can be increased at same temperature or the same rate constant can be achieved at lower temperature

#### 4.B.B. Negative Catalyst
1. Negative Catalyst decreases the rate constant, it is called Negative Catalyst
2. In Presence of negative Catalyst, the pre-exponential factor decreases and the rate constant decreases.
3. It does not affect the Activation Energy
#### 4.B.C. Observations
