[[Gaseous State MOC]]
# Real Gas
>1. When the Temperature is too high and the pressure is too low, a real gas can behave Ideally.
>2. Force of Attraction Exists between the Particles
>3. Net Volume of Gas Particles are not Zero

### Equations Under Different Conditions
#### Very High Pressure
1. Put a = 0

#### Very Low Pressure
1. Put b = 0
2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZqXFble.png)

#### Low Pressure and High Temperature
1. Put a = 0 and b = 0
2. Real Gas Only Behaves Ideally

## Liquefaction of Gases
1. Ideal Gas is not Liquefiable while Real Gases are.
2. Liquefaction of Gases Depend on Two Factors
	1. Temperature
		1. Lower the Temperature, Lower the Kinetic Energy, Higher the Rate of Liquefaction
	2. Pressure
		1. Higher the Pressure, Higher the Force of Attraction, Higher the Rate of Liquefaction
	3. Volume
	4. Higher the Critical Temperature, HIgher the Easiness of Liquefaction of Gas
1. Also Temperature is By Default has Higher Weightage in Change of Rate of Liquefaction.
