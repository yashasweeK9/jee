## 2. Ideal Gas
### 1. [[Gas Laws]]
### 2. [[Ideal Gas]]
### 3. Density of Ideal Gas
1. >$$Mass = 2 * VD$$ Where VD is Vapour Density 

2. >Density of Ideal Gas = $\rho  = \frac{PM}{RT}$

## 3. [[Real Gas]]
## 3. Moist Gas
1. Moist Gas $\implies$ Dry Gas + Water Vapour
2. > $$P_{moist} = P_{dry} + P\textdegree_{H_2O}$$
3. $P\textdegree_{H_2O}$ is an Aqueous Tension
4. $P_{dry}$ is an Ideal Gas and will follow all Ideal Gas Equations while $P\textdegree_{H_2O}$ is a Real Gas and will not follow Ideal Gas Equations. 

## 4. Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure
Refer to [[Dalton's Law]]
>[!FAQ] On mixture of $SO_2 + Cl_2$, Dalton's law of Partial Pressure is not Applicable

## 5. [[Graham's Law of Effusion|Graham's Law of Effusion]]
