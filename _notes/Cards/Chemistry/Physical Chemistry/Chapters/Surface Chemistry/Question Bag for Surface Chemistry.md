## Miscellaneous Concepts
1. The rate of physical adsorption is independent at high temperature.
2. The amount of gas absorbed on charcoal increases with Pressure and decreases with temperature
3. When a metal highly adsorbs a gas it is called Occlusion
4. Chemical Adsorption is also called __Langmuir Adsorption__. 
5. Physical Adsorption is also called __Vander Waal's Adsorption__
6. Both Chemical and Physical Adsorption are Exothermic
7. Freundlich Adsorption also forms multi molecular layers during adsorption
8. The Easier is for the Gas to form Vanderwall's Forces, the Easier to Adsorb them.
	1. The Higher the Polarity, higher the Vanderwall's Forces
	2. The Higher the Molecular Weight, higher the Vanderwall's Forces
	3. Polarity has __HIGHER__ priority than Molecular Weight in Deciding for the Vanderwall's Forces
