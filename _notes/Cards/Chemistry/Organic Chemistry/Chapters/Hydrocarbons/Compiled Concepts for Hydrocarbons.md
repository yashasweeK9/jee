1. Words to See in the Question before applying this Concept (As this has very low probability to OCCUR)
	1. Product in Less Amount
	2. Disproportionation
	3. Minor Product
2. 


0. Very Less Possibility to Occur
1. 
2. In Disproportionation a reaction in which a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced, giving two different products.
3. Radicals : In [chemistry], a **free radical** is an [atom], [molecule], or [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") that has at least one [unpaired valence electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaired_electron "Unpaired electron").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)#cite_note-2) With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly [chemically reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"). Many radicals spontaneously [dimerize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry) "Dimer (chemistry)"). Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.
