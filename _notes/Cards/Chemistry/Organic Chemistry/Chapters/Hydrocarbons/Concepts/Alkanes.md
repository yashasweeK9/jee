# Alkanes
## 1. Physical Properties

### 1.A. Boiling Point

1. Boiling Point is low due to weak Intermolecular Forces

2. Order of Boiling Point

## 2. Methods of Preparation
### 2.A. Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Compound
>[!chemrxn] Chemical Reaction
>![](https://i.imgur.com/tKMq4XB.png)
#### 2.A.A. Observations
1. Ni/Pt/Pd are Heterogeneous Catalyst
2. Wilkinson’s Catalyst is a Homogeneous Catalyst
	1. It Prefers Alkene over Alkyne #deviation
	2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/PmHqig0.png)

3. Selectivity of Reaction
	1. Alkene will be Preferred to Hydrogenate over Alkyne #deviation 
	2. Bonds of Same group with less Stable Bond Structure will Reduce Faster (Judged by Resonance or Hyperconjugation) #preference

4. Stereochemistry of Hydrogenation Reaction
	1. >[!ex] An Example
		> ![](https://i.imgur.com/UOPgU4C.png)
		1. Addition of Hydrogen is a __Syn Reaction__
		2. Here A and B are Same as there Exists a Plane of Symmetry and the compound is thus Optically Inactive #commit-to-memory 
	2. >[!ex] An Example
		>![](https://i.imgur.com/vNMiOVb.png)
		1. In Case 1 : Both Compounds are Enantiomeric Pairs
		2. In Case 2 : Both are Identical Products
		3. In Case 3 : Both Compounds are Diastereomers

5. Heat of Hydrogenation
	1. Depends in No. of Pi Bonds
	2. $H.O.H \propto \frac{1}{Stability}$
	3. Directly Proportional to Resonance and Hyperconjugation

### 2.B. Reaction of Gringard Reagent
Reaction Between Alkyl Halides[^1]
#### 2.B.A. Preparation of Gringard Reagent[^2]
1. >[!chemrxn] Chemical Reaction
>![](https://i.imgur.com/AYyvrxx.png)
>__Dry Ether__ is Taken (Note That)

2. >[!conc] Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/ZtubD54.png)
##### 2.B.A.A. Observations
1. Carbanion is a Very Strong Base
2. Good NucleophilIc Character
3. When Reacted with Compounds of Electronegative Character, __it takes away their Hydogens and forms Alkanes__

##### 2.B.A.B. Questions
>[!ques] A good Question involving concept of previous lecture on Gringard Reagent
>![](https://i.imgur.com/WzPYSY4.png)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/dXUx6LC.png)
>Above Structure Wants to be Stable and it gives out Hydrogen to be Stable (So, Gringard isse bhi Hydrogen Nikaal Lega) aur Isse Upar Diye Question mein Ek Hydrogen Aur Nikal Jayega

[^1]: _Alkyl halides_ also called haloalkanes or halogenoalkanes are chemical compounds that are often derived from alkanes that contain one or more halogens.
[^2]: A **Grignard reagent** or **Grignard compound** is a [chemical compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") with the generic formula R−Mg−X, where X is a [halogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen "Halogen") and R is an organic [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group "Functional group"), normally an [alkyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkyl "Alkyl") or [aryl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl "Aryl").

### 2.C. Wurtz Reaction
>[!visill] Visual Illustration
>__Initially__![](https://i.imgur.com/oE7yYO5.png)
__Finally__
![](https://i.imgur.com/MRucm3x.png)



Alkyl Halides Halogens ke saath dosti karte hain aur fir Na aake unhe bhaga le jaata (Apna Bana Leta hain 2NaX) hain toh dono unstable groups jud ke Bada Vala Alkane Bana lete hain

#### 2.C.A. Mechanism
#not-important 
>[!chemrxn] Chemical Reaction

##### 2.C.A.A. Observations from Mechanism
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Above Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/8kvcTxU.png)
>Even Carbon and Symmetrical Alkane only forms because of Dimerization (Fundamentally Compounds bante he hain, joda banake toh Hamesha Carbons Even he Exisit Karenge Naah)

+ Also Refer to [[Compiled Concepts for Hydrocarbons#Possibility of Disproportionation]]

+ In Wurtz Reaction $3\textdegree$ Alkyl halide is not used. (Because Disproportionation will be a major product). __Alkene__ will form as a major product


### 2.D. Intramolecular Wurtz Reaction
+ Intramolecular Reaction are more favourable than Intermolecular Reactions. Dont look for Stability of Product #byExperience 


### 2.E. Corey House Synthesis
+ Used for Odd Carbon or Non-Symmetrical Alkanes

#### 2.E.A. Gillman’s Reagent
>[!visill] Visual Illustration of Gillman’s Reagent
>![](https://i.imgur.com/992K5LM.png)
+ It is Safe to Use (Because of Non Severe Reactive Metal $Cu$)

##### 2.E.A.A. Preparation of Gillman’s Reagent
>[!chemrxn] Chemical Reaction and Preparation of Gillman’s Reagent
>![](https://i.imgur.com/vdSPR9H.png)



#### 2.E.B. Limitations of Alkyl Halide (On Which Gillman’s Reagent Reacts)
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide Limitations on Alkyl Halide #important 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/PjnoCcZ.png)

+ Yeh Chota hota hain, Zyada Steric Hindrance nahi chahiye
+ $3\textdegree$ Alkyl Halide is Prohibhited to Use becuase of Severed Syeric Hindrance

### 2.F. Kolbe’s Decarboxylation
>[!chemrxn] Chemical Reaction
>![](https://i.imgur.com/rNTrf9r.png)

+ Carbanion is fomed as a Reaction Intermediate 

+ Beta Keto Carboxylic Acid takes place without Soda Lime NaOH because in the reaction the carbon is resonance stabilized. #exception 





### 2.G. Kolbe’s Electrolysis
+ Carboxylic Acid ka Salt lena, ek carbon kum karna aur jitni cheeze bachengi unko double karke jod dena
+ Alkane Anode pe banta hain
+ Disproportionaiton ke saari Complications yahan apply hongoi

### 2.H. Clemmensor and Wolfkischner Reaction
+ Aldehyde aur Ketone eale CARBONLY groups ko reduce kardete hain Alkane

#### 2.H.A. Acids to Remember #commit-to-memory 
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Acids
>![](https://i.imgur.com/hJed1b7.png)

+ Ek Hi Compound mein Do Radical hain toh Intramolecular React Karenge aur agar single radical hain toh do tho baahar se leke jod denge aur product banayanege ^yv53ff


### 2.I. Reduction of Alkyl Halide
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Above Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Z0c0Ub3.png)

#### 2.I.A. With Zinc and HHydrocholric Acid
#### 2.I.B. With NaBH4
#### 2.I.C. With LiAlH4
+ Used Preferably
+ Highly Reactive


#### 2.I.D. BU3SnH
+ Not Recommended for Default Use
+ Highly Poisnious

## 3. Chemical Reactions
### 3.A. Free Radical Substitution Reaction
+ Yeh Reaction Badla leti hain Pehle Halogen apne aap ko todte hain phir Alkyl Ka Tod ke Uske Radical Kheech lete hain phir Alkyl badla leta hain Halogen ko kheech ke apne mein jod lete hain aur halogen ko nagha chhod dete hain, fir halogen jaake firse alkyl se badla leta aur isi tarah chain reaction chalti rehti haib

#### 3.A.A. Identical and Unidentical CH Bonds
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Identical CH Bonds
>![](https://i.imgur.com/4znSflI.png)

##### 3.A.A.A. Unidentical
+ >[!conc] Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/u9rvgB3.png)

+ Agar Carbon Chiral hain toh vahan pe carbon ek baar upar aayega aur doosri baar neeche aayega

>[!ex] An Example of Above Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Sw9M9qo.png)


>[!ex] Another Example
>![](https://i.imgur.com/7ykDmm1.png)
+ Here R and S are difference structures as the carbon at that location is chiral.



#### 3.A.B. Reactivity
+ Order
>[!conc] Concept of Order
>![](https://i.imgur.com/uqhGXUM.png)
+ Note that FRS Reaction does not take place in either of F2 or I2 Because of Very High and Slow Speed of it
+ At Cl2 and Br2 Reaction Rate is Manaageabale

+ 1 Degree Carbon Reaction is less reactive than < 2 Degree is less Reactive than 3 Degree. 

>[!visill] Visual Illustration
>![](https://i.imgur.com/XS9pok2.png)




#### 3.A.C. Reactivity and Selectivity
 + Simple si baat yeh hain ki, Chlorine hota hain bahut reactive voh har jagah banata hain compound
 + Jub Alkane mein react karega toh 2 degree ka bhi compound banayega aur 1 degree ka bhi banaya  (1 Degree vala halaki comparitively kam banayega) pur banayega zaroor.
+ Vahi on the other hand Bromine bahut Selective hain isiliye banayega bhi bahut mushkil se aur jo compound banayega voh vahi 3>2>1 degree ki preference mein banayega.
