title: Acidic Hydrogen
---

# Question Bag for General Organic Chemistry
1. Carbocation ke bagal mein lone pair dene wala atom hain toh voh compound bahut stable hota hain (Enormously Stable because of Formation of Pi Bond and Complete Octet of Carbonyl
>[!ques] Question

## Acidic Hydrogen

1. Jahan pe negative charge stable hain, voh negative charge jaldi banega aur $H+$ bhi jaldi niklega
2. Kyonki Yahan (Option d) pe Sabse Zyada Negative Charge ki Delocalization hain kyonki yahan pe teen teen pi bond ke saath resonance karega

## Basicity

1. 4th wala isliye higher hain because of its Hybridization.

## $P_{kb}$ of a Compound

1. Yahan Pe Bhaari Maatra mein Yaad He Karna Padega

## Aromatic Effect

## Compare Aromaticity

### Constants

1. Pyrrole is Aromatic whereas Protonanted Pyrrole is Non-Aromatic (Because of $Sp^3$ Hybridized Nitrogen, the compound lacks full conjugation and hence does not shoe Aromaticity) #exception

2. Agar Kisi bhi Compound mein koi $SP_3$ hybdidised Hydrogen dikh jaaye, seedhe kehna ki voh Non-Aromatic #to-categorize #trick

## Applicaion of Aromaticity
### Concepts
1. Silver Nitrate <mark class="hltr-blue">Halogens</mark> ke saath <mark class="hltr-cyan">Precipitate</mark> deta hain.
>[!excep] Exception #exception
>Fluorine as an halogen does not give Precipitate with Silver Nitrate $(AgNO_3)$ as it forms $AgF$ with Silver Nitrate which is highly Soluble because of its ionic character.

2. AgCl ka Ppt. vahan milega jahan pe Clke nikalne ke baad banne wali cheez stable hoti hain


### Questions
1. >[!ques] Which molecule can give precipitate with $AgNO_3$

## Carbocation
### Comparing the Stability
1. >[!ques] Compare the Stabillity of a given carbanion
>![](https://i.imgur.com/LoQ9hQU.png)
>1. Stability of $2^{nd}$ Compound is higher because the effect of Backbonding
>2. Backbonding will also be applied by Bromine and Iodine but due to its size it forms a bad Backbonding.

2. >[!ques] Compare the Stability of given Carbanion
>![](https://i.imgur.com/E2Z9phR.png)
>Although, Chlorine will from back bonds but in the Cyanide Case, -I and -M both effects are being applied and that to of very small CN atom, so the Stability of $2^{nd}$ Structure will be higher in this Case



3. >[!ques] Increasing order of pKa values of the following compound is
>![](https://i.imgur.com/NsM6SaU.png)

4. >[!ques] Order of $K_a$ will be
>![](https://i.imgur.com/azLT2Wq.png)

5. >[!ques] Order of basic strength of the following compounds
>![](https://i.imgur.com/nZECjZc.png)

6. >[!ques] Order of Most Stable Carbocation
>![](https://i.imgur.com/lcVaZXk.png)
>1. Concept applied here is the [[Carbocation#^ba2aa2|carbocationâ€™s likings]] anything that contradicts this is less stable
