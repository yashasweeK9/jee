## Electronic Effect

### Hybridization

![](https://i.imgur.com/KMJikx0.png)

1. $\sigma$ + lone pair over atom = Hybridization
2. In Case of Resonance (Lone Pair Wale Atoms Jo Bhaag Le Rahe Hain)
	1. Mein 1 Lone Pair Pi Bond mein Convert Ho Jata hain, isiliye Slide mein Desired Resoancne ke Jagah Original Resonance Alag Hota hain
3. In Case of Resonance (Lone Pair Nahi Hain)
	1. Resonance First Place mein Hoga He Nahin

>![](https://i.imgur.com/TwFLq3f.png)
>Is Case mein Dekho, Hybridization wahi rahegi, Kyonki Kauno, Lone Pair Particpate He Nahi Kar rahe, sab ne sigma bond bana rakha hain

### Inductive Effect

1. Weak Electrolyte
2. Sigma Bond Ke Electron Ko Attract Ya Repel Karna. Isse Electron Density Sift Hoti hain Joh MOLECLUE ke Stability aur Doosre Cheeze Ko Asar Karti hain
3. Operates Over Sigma Bond Pair
4. To Learn Most Important : Negative Effect Series, OH2 > NH3 > NO2 > SO3H > C=-N

#### Electron Withdrawing Group

1. $-I$ Effect
2. Atoms or Group which have -I Effect

	2. Gaur Karna ki Polar Pi Bond mein Pehla Atom he Bana Raha hain Pi Bond Kyonki Baad mein -I Effect Kam Ho Jata hain.

#### Electron Repelling Group

1. $+I$ Effect
2. Atoms or Group which have tendency to Repel Sigma Bond Pair

5.

#### Hydrogen

1. Net Effective Force = 0

### Application of Inductive Effect (Acid-Base Strength)

#### Strength Comparison

>[!example]- A Good Question on Comparison of Acidic and Basic Strength of Compounds
>![](https://i.imgur.com/3rCdqp1.png)

#### Acidic Strength

![](https://i.imgur.com/nebAqeM.png)

#### Basic Strength

1. $$Basic Strength \propto K_{b} \propto \frac{1}{P_{kb}}$$

#### Carbo-Cation and Carbo-Anion

>![](https://i.imgur.com/xHd6l6E.png)
1. Carbo Cation Likes +I
	1. Also 3 Degree Carbo Cation is More Stable than 2 Degree Carbo Cation than 1 Degree Carbo Cation
2. Carbo Antion Likes -I
	1. Also 1 Degree Carbo Anion is More Stable than 2 Degree Carbo Anion than 3 Degree Carbo Anion

__Yeh 3 2 1 Vala Tabhi Lagana Jub Carbo Cation Bahut Simple Sa Ho__

### Resonance

#### Participation of Empty P-Orbital In Resonance

1. Presence of Lone Pair or $\pi$ bond next to Empty P-Orbital

#### Important Points Associated with Resonance

1. If Conjugate Position contain more than 1 Pi Bond then only 1 Pi Bond will Participate in Resonance
2. If Conjugate Posiiton Contains More than 1 Lone Pair then only 1 Lone Pair will Participate in Resonance

>Mostly Unstable

#### Condition for Structure to Be Resonating Structure

If Molecules have Different Degree of Unsaturation then the Molecules are Different. If you see a pair of resonating Structure, be aware of the Degree of Unsaturation of both the Compounds

#### Stability Order for Resonating Structure

1. The Higher the Resonating Structure and Higher the Stability of those Structure, the higher the Resonance.
2. Atomic Resonance are most Stable
3.

>Apply Above Rules in the Given Priority order

#### Fridel Craft Alkylation and Fridel Craft Acylation

1. To Add Crabon chain on a benzene ring we add <mark class="hltr-yellow">Alkyly Halide</mark> with lewis acid $AlX_3$
>[!visill] Visual Illustration
>![](https://i.imgur.com/eCKrSBf.png)

2. In Fridel Acylation, we can form aromatic ketones, we add <mark class="hltr-yellow">Acid Halide</mark> and add $AlX_3$
3. Alkylation Reation Via Acylation (Preferred Over Above Reaction)
	1. We can convert Aromatic Ketone to Alkane using Clemmenson Reaction[^1] and Wolff Kishner Reduction[^2]

4. Acyl Carbocation is the Most Stable.(Because it has a Very Stable Resonating Structure)

5. Comparison between the Resonance Energy of Pyrole and Furan
	1. Pyrol is $\gt\gt\gt$ Stable than Furan because of the Positive Charge on Nitrogen compared to Negative charge on the O (which is unbearable for the Oxygen)

>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide Comparison between the Resonance Energy of Pyrol and Furan

>[!ques] Question: Which Carbon on Pyrol has Highest Electron Density?
>Resonating Structure which is more Stable has the highest contribution on the final hybrid of the molecule.
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Id16yUy.png)

6. Amide has a highest boiling Point because of the better dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding

>[!visill] Visual Illustration of the Order of the Boiling Points

>[!ques] Question : Compare the Strength of Carbonyl Bond
>Higher the Resonance, Higher the Weakening of the Double Bond and Lower the Strength of the Carbonyl Bond.

### [[Hyperconjugation Effect]]

### [[Steric Inhibition of Resonance]]

### [[Ortho Effect]]

### [[Carbocation]]

[^1]: A second way to go about reducing the carbonyl of an aromatic ketone is to use a reaction known as the Clemmensen Reduction. The reductant here is “zinc amalgam” (Zn-Hg) which is used under acidic conditions
[^2]: The Wolff-Kishner reduction is a reaction used to convert carbonyl functionalities into methylene groups in organic chemistry.
