title: Hyperconjugation
---
[[General Organic Chemistry MOC]]

# Hyperconjugation

1. Applies on Ortho and Para Position
2. It is Distance Independent
3. $-CH_3$ and Alkyly Group have tendency to donate electron by $+I$ and Hyperconjugation
4. CH3 when attached to benzene ring or any other group or atom where there is empty p-orbital it gives out electrons by a resonance like effect it is called Hyperconjugation
5. Hyperconjugation is stronger than Inductive Effect

7. Hyperconjugation is weaker than Resonance
8. $\alpha$ Carbon ke Hydrogen se interaction hota hain, carbon ke lone pair of electrons donate kar dete hain (kuch had tak) isse carbo-cation ke electron ke kami poori hojati hain ($\sigma$ bond ko donate karte hain,)

## Effects

1. Hyperconjugation shows e donation effect and hence called $+H$ Effect

## Variation in Hyperconjugation

1. Magnitude of Hyperconjugation $\propto$ No, of $\alpha C-H$ Bonds
2. Empty P-Orbital ko Mark Kark Karo aur Uske Baju Wale Carbon ke Hydrogen ko count karo.

## Application of Hyperconjugation

### 1. Carbocation

1. Inka Octet Incomplete hain

#### Stability Order of Carbanion

1. <mark class="hltr-red">__Cyclopropane__</mark> is the most electron donating group (because of its highest instability)
yeh voh dost hain jisne electron ki chain pehni hain aur marne jaa raha hain #mnemonic
2. Cyclopropane ke bagal mein + charge hota hain voh wala Cyclopropane bahut unstabole hota hain

>Ek chiz ka dhyaan rakhne ka Stability Order of Phenol (8th Group in the Slide) is more stable than its predessor because its a fact.

### 2. Radical

#### Stability Order of Radical

### 3. Alkene

### 4. Benzene

### 5. Heat of Hydrogenation

1. Energy released in Hydrogenation reaction is called heat of hydrogenation.

#### Comparison of Heat of Hydrogenation

1. H.O.H $\propto$ No. of $\pi$ bond

>[!ltex] Mathematical Illustration of Relation Between Heat of Hydrogenation, Magnitude of Hyperconjugation to Stability of an Alkene
>$$H.O.H\propto Magnitude(Hyperconjugation)\propto\frac{1}{Stability(Alkene)}$$

3. Then check Resonance
4. Then check Hyperconjugation
