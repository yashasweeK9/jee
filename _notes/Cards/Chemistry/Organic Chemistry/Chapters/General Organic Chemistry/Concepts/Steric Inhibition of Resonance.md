# Steric Inhibition of Resonance
1. Jub Koi Bulky Group Ek Aise Compound Ke Paas aake chipak jaata hain joh pehle se hi resonance kar raha tha aur naye wale ke chipakne ke kaaran repulsion badh jaata hain toh jo group resonance kar raha tha voh naye wale ki iss chipku behaviour ko resist karne ke liye rotate kar jaata hain, jiske falswaroop resonance bhi diminish ho jaata hain.

2. Sreric Inhibition of Resoanance diminished the Resonances thus making the overall compound less Stable
>[!ex] An Example between the Stability of two compounds one in which there is no effect of S.I.R Effect and in one S.I.R effect exists.

3. Effect of S.I.R does not apply on $OH$ as it is very compact (not Spreaded)
4. Effect of S.I.R always apply on $NO_2$ as it is very Spreaded
5. With S.I.R Bond Length of the Compound Increases, because SIR effect will diminish the very effect of Resonance jiske falswaroop Double ya Partial bonds nahi banenge aur jaisa ki hamein pata hain ki Single Bond ki bond length zyada hoti hain (Double or Partial Ke Rigidity ka kaaran voh fael nahi sakte)

>$$S.I.R \propto bond-length$$
