# Alkyl Halides
## 1. Properties of Alkyl
### 1.A. Dipole Moment and Boiling Point
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Dipole Moment
>![](https://i.imgur.com/6OjYPJV.png)

+ Chlorine has higher dipole moment than Fluorine because of its  larger bond length and higher elecronegativity.

+ Boiling Point depends on VDF and D-D Forces. We see that Dipole-Dipole Forces do not differ a lot so all the change in the boiling point is about the VDF. Where Iodine with the highest molecular weight has the highest Boiling Point,

### 1.B. Boiling Point of Alkyl Halides
+ Jaise Jaise Halogen ki Sankhya badhegi vaise vaise Dipole Moment Cancel hone lagega, isiliye CH3CL mein maximum Dipole hain and CCL4 mein minimum dipole hain

+ Sabse Zyada Boiling Point Amide ka hota hain
+

+ Jitna Zyada Angle between the bonds utna kam dipole-dipole moment.

	+ Boiling Point $O\gt P\gt M$ and Melting Point $P \gt O \gt M$







## 2. Chemical Reaction in Alkyl Halide
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Initial Understanding of the Above Concept
>![](https://i.imgur.com/T6sATIh.png)

+ Alkyl Halide are very Reactive in nature, because of the following
	+ In Alkyl Halide Carbon-Halogen Bond is Quite Polar in Nature
	+ Halogen's are very good Leaving Group

### 2.A. Among Alkyl and Aromatic Halide
>[!lecpg] Lecture Slide for Above Concept

+ Vinyl Halide mutlab jub Carbon Directly Juda ho, double bond se.
+ Upar Wale itne reactive nahi hote kyonki, Upar Ke Do mein Hota hain Badhiya Wala Resonance aur last wala __Bridge Head__ hain, usmein bahut steric hindrance hota hain

#### 2.A.A. Bridge Head

+ Polarity is not possible
+ Aur Baaki Koi Bhi Effect Possible nahi hain



### 2.B. Leaving Ability of Groups
+ Alkyly Halide is a good leaving group if HX is a very good acid. 
>[!excep] Exception #exception
>HF is a Weak Acid while HCl, HBr and HI are very Strong Acids

#### 2.B.A. Order of Leaving Ability of Groups

+ Because H+ Jodne pur yeh sulhonic acid ban jaate hain jo bahut he tagda acidic group hain

+ In the above Example, NH2, NO3, NO2 we firstly find theri conjugate acid by adding +H into their respective compounds and then see their strength by their oxidation number




### 2.C. Chemical Reactions in Alkyl Halide

#### 2.C.A. Substitution Reactions
+ In Normal Conditions of Temperature and Pressure
+ Nucleophile are those species who donate their electron to species other than H+ (Mainly C+) while in conrast to base who donate their electron to H+ ions only.

+ Jub Bhi Check karna ho, A- aur B- ke beech mein which is more basic toh unke conjugate acid ko compare karo, Agar A ka Conjugate Acid Zyada Strong hain toh B as a Base Zyada Strong Hoga aur B ka Conjugate Acid Zyada Strong hain toh A as a Base Sabse Zyada Strong hota hain
