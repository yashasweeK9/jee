[[Stereoisomerism]]
# Optical Isomerism
1. Optically Active - Which Rotates Plane Polarized Light 
![](https://i.imgur.com/pjzTD36.png)
	1. levo-rotatory (Anti-Clockwise)
	2. dextro-rotatory (Clockwise)
2. Optically Inactive

## Condition for Optical Activity
For a molecule to be optically active it must have absence
1. Plane of Symmetry

3. Center of Symmetry
	1.  Cis aur Para Substituents hone chahiye for Center of Symmetry to Exists

4. Alternate Axis of Symmetry


## Chiral Coumpound
1. Optically Active Compound is called Chiral Compound

### Optically Active Compound without Chiral Carbon
#### Allene
1. Even Continuous $\pi$ Bond
2. Terminal Carbon Contains Different Groups
	1. If Allene Contains Odd number of $\pi$ bond with terminal carbon containing group then these compounds will not be Optically Active but will show Planeer Geometric Isomerism

#### Biphenyl
1. Phenyl Ke Do Rings Ka Structure
2. Both Rings Should be Asymmetrically Substituted.
3. Rings Ke Joint Wale Kono mein Koi Atleast 3 Bulky Compounds Jude Hone Chahiye, so that voh ek doosre ke differential forces ke kaaran kisi bhi bond ko theda karde aur Plane of Symmetry Gayab ho jaye.

## Enantiomers
They Represent different molecule that have Equal and Opposite optical rotation

## Meso Compounds
Meso Compounds are those Compounds which contain Chiral carbon but they are Optically Inactive.

## Nomenclature
### R&S Nomenclature
1. R,S Nomenclature is done for Chiral Carbon
2. Fischer Projection (3D to 2D)
	![](https://i.imgur.com/VA9AKFI.png)
	1. Identical Group if they are on Opposite Side that is called : Threo 
	(Mnemonic:__O__ (Opposite) peration __T__ (threo)heater)
	3. Identical Group if they are on Same Side that is called : Erythreo
#### Carrying out RS Nomenclature
1. Mark Chiral Carbon
2. Give Priority Order to groups attached to Chiral Carbon
3. Least Priority Group should be placed at behind the plane (Vertical Line) (By Swapping {Even Number Swapping Doesn;t affect anyhin})
4. Cyclic Order of 1,2,3
	1. If Clockwise (R)
	2. If Anti-Clockwise (S)
5. #exception If least Priority Group is placed above the Plane
	1. 1,2,3 Clockwise is (S)
	2. 1,2,3 Anti-Clockwise is (R)
6. Labeling

### D&L Nomenclature
1. Carbohydrates which contains Aldedhydes are called Aldose
2. Carbohydrates which contains Ketones are called Ketose
3. How to Form Correct Structure before Seeing the Side of OH and $NH_2$
	1. All the Carbon Containing Function Groups must be in a Chain
	2. The Main Functional Group must be at the Top of the Chain
	3. Last Chiral Carbon Ki State Ko Dekhiye
#### L-Glyceraldehyde
![](https://i.imgur.com/RYyPFOQ.png)
1. OH is placed at Left Side that it is called L-Glyceraldehyde
2. If a Compound (After Some Given Reaction) can be converted to L-Glyceraldehyde we can name it L-Glyceraldehyde
#### D-Glyceraldehyde
![](https://i.imgur.com/uzk3ulN.png)
1. OH is placed at Right Side that it is called D-Glyceraldehyde
2. If a Compound (After Some Given Reaction) can be converted to D-Glyceraldehyde we can name it D-Glyceraldehyde
