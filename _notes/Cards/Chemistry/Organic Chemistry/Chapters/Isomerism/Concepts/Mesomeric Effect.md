1. Resonance ke dwara Electron ka transfer hona is called Mesomeric Effect
2. Mesomeric Effect is only applicable when Resonance is present
3. Yeh Transfer Bahut Strong hota hain because yeh $\pi$ bond bahut strong hota hain
4. +M Effect voh hota hain jub koi atom or group apne upar + Charge Laata hain or <mark class="hltr-yellow">Electron Repelling Group</mark>
5. -M Effect or <mark class="hltr-yellow">Electron Attracting Group</mark>
6. Mesomeric Effect is applicable over only ortho and para Position
7. Magnitude of Mesomeric Effect is independent of the Distance
8. Mesomeric Effect is stronger than Inductive Effect

## 1. +M Effect #important

1. If Atom or Group has a lone Pair and this lone pair participates in resonance they show +M Effect

Nahi Oh Orat #mnemonic

## 2. -M Effect #important

If Atom or Group has a Polar Pi Bond and this Polar $\pi$ bond participates in resonance they show -M Effect

1. Sp3 Hybridization does not have Mesomeric Effect because of its powerful $-I$ Effect they show all the effects and properties of a typical Resonating Structure
