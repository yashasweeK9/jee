# Isomerism
1. Molecules with Same Formula but different Properties are called Isomers
2. Two Molecules can exhibit more than one type of Isomerism


## Types of Isomers
### Structural or Constitutional Isomerism
#### Chain Isomerism
Jin Do Molecule ke Parent Chain he Alag hain
#### Positional Isomerism
1. Jinke Do Molecule toh Same hain pur Functional Group, Ya Bonds Ya Substituents mein Difference hain
2. Otho Meta and Para Isomers are Positional Isomers

#### Functional Isomers
1. Two Molecules having Same Formula but they differ in Nature of Functional Group
##### Finding Functional Isomers
1. Step 1 : Degree of Unsaturation __i.e. Sum of $\pi$ bonds and Cyclic Rings__ or __2n+2-{no. of H + no, of X(halogens)-no. of nitrogens}/2__ where n is the number of Carbon

	1. Agar DOU 4 ho aur 4 se adhik ho hum Beneze Ring Daalenge he Dalenge.

2. Primary Secondary Tertiary Amines are Different Functional Groups

>As Illustrated in the Above Example both Sturctures are different because the first Structure is Tertiary Amine while other is Secondary Amine
4. Aliphatic and Aromatic Alcohol are also Different Functional Groups
#### Metamers
1. Metamers are Positional and Chain Isomers Also
	1. Jinke Pass Divalent Functional Group Present hota hain

2. Matemerism ke Liye 3 Se Adhik Carbon Ka Hona Avashyak Hain
3. Divalent Group Ke Along koi Chnage aata hain.

## Extra Baatein
1. __Sulpher__ bilkul __Oxygen__ Jaisa hota hain __thiol__ and __thioether__ naam ke functional group sambhav hote hain
